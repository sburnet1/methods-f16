What is Research ?
Research is whenever we want to gather information on something , that we have little or no idea about it. For example, if we had to know when 
President Barack Obama was born , we will google " Barack Obama Birthday " , this is called research. We dont just reasearch when we have to do
a paper or homework , but we do research daily, so we can say that   daily we are  dependent on someones else written information. According to 
author  Gregory G. Colomb, and Joseph M. Williams defination of resarch is " In the broadest terms , we do research whenever we gather information
to answer a question that solves a problem". which is kind of similar defination of research I thought before reading the book.
 In the book The Craft of  Research , authir Gregory talks about how to write an perfect research papers that your teachers or whoever is your 
 readers will like. "If instead you find a topic that you care about ask a question that you want to answer, then pursue that answer as best you can 
 your project can have the fascination of a mystery whose solution richly reward your efforts. So  I agree with him , we need your commmintment  to
 write an successful paper.we need to believe ourself , our believe , eventhough we couldnt find anyone agreeing or being with us.
