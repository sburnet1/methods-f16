After running into quite a few problems and not getting the data I was looking for I'm going to end up changing the project.

  I'm going to do speaking times of villains and henchman in James Bond films. Data for Dr. No and Spectre are already done. The main problems for the data so far have been knowing which characters are classified as henchman. Then, knowing the ethnicity of each henchman, specifically in older Bond films, where I can't find information on actors so I end up using my own judgement. 
  A list of henchman for each Bond film was found on Wikipedia, which isn't the most credible website, but I did check it with the Bond wiki and from watching the film. The list includes the main henchman, but doesn’t example include the Silver Wraith driver in Spectre, which I think is reasonable. I'm going to include henchman that are clearly helping to further the main villain’s plans with full knowledge of what’s going on. 
    The ethnicity/race is also a problem. The US census definition for each race was used such as white being "A person having origins in any of the original peoples of Europe, the Middle East, or North Africa." The problem comes when I attempt to look up older actors, the ethnicity are not easily found, for the minor characters I am using my best judgement for ethnicity/race.
    I will update this blog post before next class when I have all of the data done.
