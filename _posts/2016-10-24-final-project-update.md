Emma and I's final project involves video analysis of the hit TV show [_Shameless_](http://www.sho.com/shameless) (U.S edition). As a show that has taken Hollywood by 
storm, with its seemingly endless controversial topics, crude language, and borderline pornographic scenes, _Shameless_ is a goldmine 
for analysis. Although not finalized yet, we have many ideas we are considering looking at. 
We are thinking of looking not just the characters in the show, but also the objects and props used. In one idea, we were thinking 
of picking a popular yet nonchalant object that is ties back to a social and/or political area for our society. Another idea consists 
of looking at Lip's, one of the main characters, network within the TV show. Lip grows up in Back of the Yards, on the south side of 
Chicago, where he mostly makes his way through life lying, cheating, and stealing. However, in a turn of events Lip also ends up 
attending MIT, where he links a whole new type of character set to the show. But, there are also characters that Lip meets at college
from Back of the Yards. We were thinking of creating a network for Lip to see how his life at college relates back or comes in full circle with the people he meets at college.
