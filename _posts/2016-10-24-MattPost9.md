Our research question is, has the writing of science fiction changed over the years as both writing and science has evolved. Is this writing change, if any, visable in any type of syntax, grammar, or other forms of writing characteristics. We believe, that yes, it has, and that evolution of writing characteristics will be visible and be able to be displayed as a visual representation, to better understand its context. 


After doing research on the topic, we looked at a graph of the amount of sci-fi novels being released each year. This graph shows that science fiction books have been growing exponentially since the release of Utopia in the 16th century. We will most likely being doing an analysis of 19th century science fiction books vs 20th century scientific books. This should give as a good range of novels to choose from, as well as being less difficult to gather the texts needed to be analyzed.
