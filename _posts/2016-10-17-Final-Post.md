For our final project, Amina and I chose to test an experiment using the presidential candidates' twitters
and determining the bash/cristicism compared to self build up ratio. With this information, we are going to 
create a video, dipicting the ratios and analyzing the meaning of our data at the end of the video.

Topic: Campaigning for U.S. president.
Question: What's the bash/cristicism compared to self build up ratio.
Significance: Hostility, poor policy, poor campaigning, threats to democracy.

We are going to research this topic by compiling the 100 most recent personal tweets from each candidate
and record which ones fit into which category. Obviously some are not going to fit into either category, 
therefore these will be categorized as miscellanous. Another addition to this research project is figuring
out facts that apply to campaigning strategy.
