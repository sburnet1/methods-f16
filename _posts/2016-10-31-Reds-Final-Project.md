# Pop Music Trend Since 2000
=

Is it just me or has music gotten more and more vulgar?  It seems that older music that hit
top ten was not as explicit as it is today.  I'm a big fan of Rock from the 50's, 60's, 70's,
and early 80's, from Elvis Presley and Chuck Berry to Led Zepplin and AC/DC.  As much as these
artists from the past allude to sexual ideas, they keep the dirty language to a minimum as 
opposed to today's chart toping songs, which seem to me to not care much about word choice.

For me and my partner's final project we decided to see if what we thought we saw in pop music
was indeed an actual phenomenon or just our imagination(similar to our parents saying, "Back in
my day, we were more discrete...").  At first we were gonna do all the top songs of every year
since 1958 to 2015.(-_-). We immediately realized thats like a bujilion songs, and 2 bujilion lines
of lyrics to scan.  So we capped it from the turn of the century (2000) to 2015.  Considering
the fact that there is still 100 top sings in every year, we were still gonna have 1500 songs
to scan. No, that was still a crap ton so we settled on top 10 songs of each year, to have a 
total of 150 songs to scan. Since I don't even know have many songs are in a bujilion, I consider
150 quite doable.

Very similar to how we scanned the novels in class using python scripts, we are gonna scan 
the lyrics of the songs.  Well search each songs for the count of vulgar words that it contains
to hopefully see that the top 10 songs in 2000 were using less explicit language than today's 
top 10. Hopefully.  This doesn't seem too dificult of a task, but definetly time comsuming
since we gotta scan 150 txt documents that contain the lyrics to songs.

Let's hope everything goes well. And that's Red's Final Project.
