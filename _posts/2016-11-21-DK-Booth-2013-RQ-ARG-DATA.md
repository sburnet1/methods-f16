**Research Question**

How does the phenomenon of fandom occur, and what makes fans special?

This research question is mentioned in Booth’s introductory paragraph: “In my research, I’ve tried to discover some of the different 
ways people have become fans, because I’m interested in learning about what makes fans special…” (Booth, 73).


**Arguments**

“All fans approach fandom differently” (Booth, 73). 

“Beyond speaking about their favorite show, however, fans also note a shift in their own identity, from a time when
they *weren’t* fans – when they were just viewers settling down to watch something they knew little about – to a time 
when they were” (Booth, 74).


**Data Summary**

2011 Chicago TARDIS *Doctor Who* fan convention. Americans interviewed instead of traditional British (native to the TV show) individuals 
and/or groups. 

The data collected primarily consists of interviews. This is certainly a reasonable choice when investigating individuals’ fan interests, 
as well as the idea of fandom overall. The main method of gathering such evidence would, of course, be to **ask** these people how they
felt about their journey into fandom, and how they would describe the process.

Data interviewing over 21 individuals on their fandom memories, emotions, and thoughts surrounding the recollection and fandom phenomenon.
