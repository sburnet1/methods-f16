title: Splatter Art Argument + Possible Change

I might be changing my research project.

My problem is that I don't have a claim, and all my reasons are data related. If I was to have a claim it would be that splatter art does have recurring patterns that can be used to determine if something is splatter art. Then, the reason would be that there is a pattern for color location and distance, with my evidence being the color analysis. The problem here is that it relies on my data which I don’t have, and that data working out. That would be my only reason, so I’m thinking about changing my research project to something else.

Topic: Villains in James Bond films.
Question: How has the portrayal of villains in James Bond films changed from the start of the series to the current generation.
Significance: I’ve seen articles for villains being mostly white and then I’ve seen articles about villains being all minorities. I thought it would be interesting to see how they were portrayed in James Bond films because the films start during the civil rights movement and move all the way to the present. It would show if there was a difference in portrayal after civil rights movement, specifically in the present.

Claim: The portrayal of villains from the civil rights era to present in James Bond films is still favored towards white men. I might change this after I re-watch some of the films and have actual data other than quick internet search data.

Reason: Almost all the main villains in James Bond are of the same race and gender.
Evidence: Only four films did not have a white man as the main villain. One had a black man as the main villain, two had female co-villains, and one had an Asian co-villain.

The next set of reasons require data, so I might change the claim to reflect it.

Reason: 
Evidence: Comparing the speaking roles of white villain to minority/female villain.

Reason:
Evidence: Comparing the speaking roles of white henchman to minority/female henchman. 

Alternatives/Complications/Objections:
The henchman where diverse even during the early Bond films.
The reason that they were diverse is because they were there to reflect the setting.

Note: I will do 3-5 of the oldest films and the 3-5 newest films, also I will the analysis on the films that had female/minority villains.
