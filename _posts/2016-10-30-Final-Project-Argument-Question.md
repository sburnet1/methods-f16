  In our “revised final project” blog post, we discussed how we will be using text analysis to analyze past versus present science fiction books. Significant textual differences such as, positive versus negative words, frequency of novel-relevant words, text patterns, grammatical relationships, and more. The goal of this project is to yield impactful statistical data that will bring us to qualitatively analyze the differences and come up with insightful conclusions. Therefore our argument question is, “How has the language, syntax, and grammar of science fiction novels changed overtime?”
