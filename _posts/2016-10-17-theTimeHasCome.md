### Finals are upon us

It's a sad, sad, sad, very super extremely sad time. We still have half the semester left and its already time to think about a final project (not for just one class, like all the classes!!!). But enough complaining, I have better things to do (like figure out what my projects are going to be).

BEFORE I GO ON, I must say this post will be written by both me (rsjudka) and Carlos (Red), so if at any point while reading this post you notice things get super scholarly, you'll know it's Red who's writing

AND THE REASON THIS POST HAS TWO AUTHORS IS BECAUSE RED AND I WILL BE WORKING ON OUR PROJECT TOGETHER SO WE WILL BE CONTRIBUTE TO THIS BLOG POST DESCRIBING OUR PROJECT'S QUESTION, PLAN, AND THE WAY IN WHICH WE PRESENT OUT PROJECT. wooohoooooooo!

Carlos and I originally discussed how it would be interesting to see how social media "buzz" correlated with new movie releases, and whether that "buzz" would cause higher ticket sales in days to come. However, when looking at the movies that are soon to be releases, there aren't many that seem to have high expectations of popularity, and we feel like it may be a bit more difficult to collect out data. So, with this little misfortune, our planning kind of gets messed up, since we don't have a topic anymore (but we're currently brainstorming one!). That being said, I still think we want to measure correlation between social media and some sort of event (although what event is still to be decided). We plan on collecting this data by scouring the twitter feeds of the world (if that's possible) and trying to find if an increase in tweets caused greater demand for the event (specifically, the event must be some sort of release) . The time line still needs to be decided since our data gathering will need to be tied to the events we will be studying.

Graphs are nice and pretty, but animation is where it is at! So, hopefully if we can create a timeline that give us the opportunity, it would be interesting to see how we can use ANIMATED GRAPHS to express our findings.
