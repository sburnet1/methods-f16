For final project , I will be doing male/female ratio in Indian films.  Gender enquality in films is worse than you can think. According to author Laham , "Women filled just 28.7 percent of these roles in films theatrically released during 2014.  Which is way better numbers  if you compare it to Indian films.  According to TImes Magazine , an Indian magazine , stated that  in Indian films woman filled just 10-12% of roles , from which 75% of thier scenes goes into sexually revealing clothes and partially naked , which goes higher if the actors  are new or not very known. 
So , for this project I  choosed an  Indian film called  "Theri(meaning Spark)" , where I will count male/female ratio , how many male and female charcters in movie , and how many dialogues given to female compare to male . So , I will be generating data by watching movie , and seeing whom talks to whom , and if actor is an female or male .And I will be posting  data on NodeXL , and I am still trying to figure out what I will do after putting data on NodeXL.
