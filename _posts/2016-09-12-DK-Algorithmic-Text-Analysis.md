Digital Humanities collaborates with mathematics to conduct the process of algorithmic text analysis. It does so in order to
be capable of understanding the hidden elements of a given text. This is achieved via the implementation of mathematics, to obtain 
new evidence for sophisticated argumentation. Using algorithms, literature can be observed through an entirely different lens.
Breaking down text components and unveiling patterns allows for the discovery of evidence, that which may be unique to algorithmic
text analysis. In turn, one is able to form more powerful conclusions than before.

For instance, Stephen Ramsay, an expert on the subject of algorithmic text analysis writes: "Texts are browsed, searched, and 
disseminated by all but the most hardened Luddites in literary study, but seldom are they transformed algorithmically as a means of 
gaining entry to the deliberately and self-consciously subjective act of critical interpretation" (167). This establishes a brief
overview of the significance of algorithmic text analysis. It emphasizes its use an alternative method to achieve a most critical
interpretation. This will isolate the subjective elements incorporated by authors in their works, from the objective components.
