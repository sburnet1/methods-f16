In her writing Anne Francis , which she was heavily influenced by  famous social theorist Pierre Bourdieu, she talks about birth and rise of Tumblr's. I will agree with author on this ,  since Tumblr started , Tumblr popularity had risen rapidly than any other social media , we can say Tumblr is star of social media . Also Anne Francis talks about how Tumblr  gained popularity  because of easy use  , which is true like twitter and facebook ,  without any incovience you  can write , posts pictures and videos with ease.  

Author Anne Francis talks on how easy to use by just simply username and password , in her article she states " Tumblr’s signup simply consists of entering a password and user name of your choice and then starting your “tumblelog,” " , which she thinks is an powerful  features , forgetting that pretty much every social mmedia consists of what shes describing.Yet I think Tumblr is a kind of unique than other social media  because of thier mutlitple users , live chatting and many more .
