### So what is new?

This project is one of the most interesting topics I find in my days.  Why does that person do that? Why did they react that way? And so many other questions pop up when thinking of texting. Which is faster? Which is more fun to simply do?  Which is technically more secure?   We hope to answer these questions in our video presentation brought to you by A Video Experience.  

###Struggle bus

With every project, there are certain obstacles that we face.  This project is no different.  Despite knowing exactly what we are doing and having it be a credible research project, I just wish that we could have months more time to do our own organic research.  Actually do some surveying and find out what the people around us feel.  More than just a few friends, why not dozens?!  For the project timeline though, we can only do so much.  Yet, it is what we make of it that counts, right?
