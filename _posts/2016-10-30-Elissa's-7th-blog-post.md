This post like shampoo that has three benefits but comes in one bottle, comes to you in three parts.

## Part 1: More Categories

  According to George Semenza, there are six types of article arguments. 
  
  Controversy: The author looks at a controversy within an academic field, and argues their take of the controversy.
  
  Textual Crux: The author takes a word and argues that the word has an alternative definition that the reader may not have thought of.
  
  Gap in Scholarship: The author researches an area in academia that hasn't been researched before, presents their findings and interpretation of their collected data to "close" the gap in scholarship.
  
  Historical Context: The author uses historical context to back their argument.
    
  Pragmatic Proposal: Similar to the application of a good research question, the author gives an application that can be implemented which they back by their argument.
  
  Theoretical Application: Similar to pragmatic proposal, only the author's application is theoretical or has not be thoroughly tested to be considered truly applicable, but the author's argument provides information as to why the application could be possible.

## Part 2: Bob's Category

  My argument is that Bob's Burgers in a feminist show. I believe my argument will fall into the gap in scholarship category. While there are articles about Bob's Burgers being feminist, there isn't substantial data behind their arguments are similar to Laci Green's. By using social network maps, I will be able to provide data to back arguments behind not only my article but other articles about Bob's Burgers.

## Part 3: Trouble Shooting
 
 I downloaded an excel spreadsheet that will allow me to start mapping my social networks. I realized that there may be an episode in the first season of Bob's Burger that has transgender characters. I will classify them as the gender they identity with, however I believe that the episode uses their gender identity as part of the main joke of that sequence of scenes. I haven't gotten to that episode yet, but it's definitely something I have to think about when I look at what topics are being discussed in each episode.
 I am also unsure as to what constitutes as a reliable source for episode scripts. There are websites that I have found that have all claim to have all the episode scripts, but most are crowd sourced to obtain their material. I want to use a reliable website to aid in my topic analysis however I'm unsure as to what constitutes as a reliable source in this context.
