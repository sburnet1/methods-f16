"Digital humanities, which began as a term of consensus amongst a relatively small group of researchers is now backed on a growing number of campuses by a level of funding, 
infrastructure, and administrative commitments that would have been unthinkable even a decade ago. Even more recently, I would argue, the network effects of blogs and Twitter
 at a moment when the academy itself is facing massive and often wrenching changes linked both to new technologies and the changing political and economic landscape has led 
to the construction of “digital humanities” as a free floating signifier, one which increasingly serves to focus the anxiety and even outrage of individual scholars over their 
own lack of agency amid the turmoil in their institutions and profession."  I have took some Humanities class , i thought this  class could be like , the one i took like biography 
about greek philosopher. I didnt expected same as I took before , I thought it would be some what similar , but its so different then I took before. What i thought when I heard first 
time the word "Digital Humanitites" is that it is some kind of tools for engineers , scientits and many other to pursue something in thier field. WHich is false , "Digital humanitites 
is actually some researchers who is backing of campuses by funding and infrastrucute and and administrative commitments which could have not done decade ago" , as stated above.
