Who knew you learning lots of new technology would be involved in conducting a DIGITAL HUMANITIES Research Project? Not me, obviously.  

I am currently working through the wrinkles and hiccups in running the python script on my laptop. Running python scripts (from what I understand) requires a lot more than just being able to press a "run" button. ALso, I'm running the python on my Linux and using the terminal to get things done which is more efficient, but also more confusing.  

I do not yet have data, but I have read up a lot on research that has to do with more close readings of the texts in question. I have encountered many arguments and explanations that support my claim. New interpretations of texts based on contexts and perspectives and understanding the history of transcription and translation of the texts in different parts of the world also aide in understanding how these texts may or may not have changed over time.  

I hope to use a combination of my research of other professionals' close readings, understanding nuances in interpretation, and data from the tf-idf I conduct as evidence for my claim.
