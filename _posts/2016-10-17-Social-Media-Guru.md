Not to brag, but social media is my jam. I've been called a "Social Media Guru" by my boss, but that's probably because it's my job. I've been Illinois Tech's Social Media Intern for almost 2 years now and it's definitely been eye-opening in the strategies to social media. I like social media because I'm a millenial and that's essentially how I got the job in the first place. "Do you know how to post on Facebook?" "Yes." "You're hired!" Okay. That's not how it happened, but that's how it feels sometimes. So learning about a more indepth analysis of social media has definitely peaked my interest. However, what this reading by Kadushin made me think about is people who don't interect with social media at all.

I'm not talking about our parents or grandparents, because it's normal for them, but what about other people in their 20s. It's rare to come accross someone who isn't, at least, on Facebook. And I know multiple people who are not! For me, I cannot imagine it because social media is such an integral part in my personal and professional life. Especially in the reading, Kadushin talks about networks and networking and how social media plays into that. Does refraining from social media hinder your span of your network and your networking abilities?
