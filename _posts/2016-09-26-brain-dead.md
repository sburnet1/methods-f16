I don't know about the rest of the class, but I've started to become brain dead. I read the readings and I actively listen in class, but I still feel like I am not absorbing anything. Maybe it's senioritis or maybe I'm not as good of a reader that I thought I was. To be honest, I am so excited to watch something in class instead of only reading. Hopefully my years of watching television has prepared me for greatness.
