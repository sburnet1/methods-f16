title: What is my claim?

So the other day we went through what to do for making a strong question for our final project, and to do so we went through a series of questions that would help support what we are working on. Some of it was a bit confusing as to what each question is asking for according to how we broke it down. Confusing in the way that the second question is to support the first, and the third supports the second, but I can use the third and skip the second, so what do I do with my second question. Anyways, I figured I would give it all a try anyways and see how it all works out.

Going back real quick to what my final project is supposed to be for a little context. I want to research the male vs female ratio in the top literatures for the past decade, and analyses how the higher mtf for ftm ratio has as an effect on its ranking in the top literatures in the past decade. 

So, the first question is: What is my claim? Well my claim should state something, preferably true or false. The best way that I see for me to make a claim it to just pick a side and go for it. So I claim: that literature with a higher male to female ratio will rank higher in the list of top literature. 

Next is what reasons support my claim? This should just be a supporting line towards what my claim is, but I’m not entirely sure how to go about it. Initially I am thinking well this is a gender based question involving favorability, so claim sexism. The world is sexist, men are seen as superior, bla bla bla. But really is that not a good reason. I mean, it supports why I initially went with a higher male ratio will rank higher then books with a higher female ratio. Maybe I’m just another one of the horrible people in the world that doesn’t see it as equal and this is my subconscious letting that show. Well, if so, I apologize to all of the females reading this, as well as anyone else that is non gender conforming. I do my very best to be respectful of everyone no matter what age, sex, gender, orientation, or any other thing they may or may not be…unless they are a jerk, then do what you want, but don’t expect much help from me.

With a claim and a reason, now I need evidence. How shocking that my next question is: What evidence supports my reasons? Well in my case, it will be the data that I collect that will support my claim, but is that really supporting my reasoning. That’s where I get confused. I suppose it could, but it doesn’t directly show the world being sexist, just something that is a result from it.

Additionally, I have to acknowledge alternatives/objections/complications, and how I respond to them. Well I acknowledge before I even start, that I may completely fail to support my claim. Its completely one sided. If the female ratio is higher in top rated books, I’m done for…well not really, but as far as this claim goes, just about. So that leads to how I react and respond to it. Well I could redo everything so all my work is then supported by the new knowledge I have and make it look like I was right all along. I mean at least I will look good, but it would be twice the work. I could just accept my claim as wrong and investigate as to why and how and acknowledge that women are better than men. 

Not to be political, but I do hope so with this election coming up.

Finally, what principle (warrant) justifies connecting your reasoning to your claim? Well I feel like having a claim that is inclusive of gender, and having my reasoning based off of sexism, the discrimination on the basis of gender, they kind of support each other.

Does any of that seem like it would work out? Or make sense?
