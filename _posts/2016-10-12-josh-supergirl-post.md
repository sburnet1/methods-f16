title: "Supergirl: Who Speaks?"

This post will cover the data I collected in class last week while watching the pilot episode of [Supergirl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supergirl_(TV_series)).

### [The collected data](https://www.dropbox.com/s/jw8o7wcwd4qt2zw/supergirl.xlsx?dl=0)

Up until the last 8 minutes of the episodes, I recorded the name of every character who spoke in the order in which they spoke. Afterwards, I went back and coded each speaker as either male or female (or "both" in a couple of instances in which the "speaker" was a crowd of people.). The few instances in which I couldn't remember the gender were marked with question marks.

A few notes on the data:

* In some cases, you'll see that the same name is recorded more in a row. This is due to one of two reasons. Either (a) the person paused for a considerable length (more than a few seconds) or (b) one scene ended and another began with the same character speaking.

* The data go up until the point where Kara/Supergirl is speaking with the holographic projection of her mother.

* Instances in which Kara Zor-El was dressed in her superhero costume but was conversing with people who knew her true identity were recorded as Kara Zor-El as speaking.

### A brief analysis

The breakdown of total utterances by gender is as follows:

* Female = 119
* Male = 78
* Both = 2
* Don't remember = 2

Thus, it appears that females have >60% of all speaking roles. Comparing this to some of the extant data on utterances in [film](http://polygraph.cool/films/) and [television](http://www.indiewire.com/2015/02/sorry-ladies-study-on-women-in-film-and-television-confirms-the-worst-65220/) by gender, it's clear that the 3:2 ratio of female to male utterances is *much* higher than the average.
