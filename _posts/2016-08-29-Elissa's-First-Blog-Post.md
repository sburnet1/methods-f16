1.) Which research methods do you most want to learn?
I am interested in expanding my ability as a writer. I would like to study research methods about presenting arguments, whilst also connecting to the reader. I feel as though most students come out of high school knowing how to generally present an argument on paper, however the argument is presented in a formulaic way, making every paper sound similar. I would like to learn how to write argumentative papers in a more "free" style that connects with my reader.

2.) What topics in digital humanities research interest you?
I am most interested in research, writing, design and modeling aspects of digital humanities. These are some of the same aspects that drew me to engineering, but not coding. Coding is something that I know that I will have to do , but I will avoid it if I can. It's just this other worldly thing that I cannot wrap my head around.

3.) Which [digital literacies](https://libbyh.github.io/research-methods-in-digital-humanities/#cultural-competencies) do you most want to master?
Performance is a digital literacy that I would like to improve upon. Being able to improvise is an ability that I know how to do however it's not something that I do all the time, and I would like to increase my confidence in my ability to do so.
