I already did a post on final project ideas but it was not in the correct format with a topic, question, and significance. 

Final Project Idea 1:
Topic: Splatter Art
Question: What are quantifiable features of splatter art?
Significance: What does it mean to be splatter art and how can quantifiable features be used to spot splatter art?

Splatter art was created by Jackson Pollock. He would use his entire range of motion to create art, which is going to be a challenge to quantify. There were two reasons that drew me towards splatter art. The first one is that I would like to practice some of my coding skills. In both of the coding classes I took we had to manipulate a picture, so I feel like this would be within my skill range. The other reason is that during the discussions in class, it seemed that part of digital humanities was quantifying humanities/media that normally are not quantified such as the amount of white space in a book, or the amount of action verbs for each gender. In art classes I have taken, I have heard details about an artist's style, background, perspective, etc. But I have never heard an artist be described by how much of a certain color they use or where they put that color. 

For the artifact I would like to create a picture with the average color per position for someone like Jackson Pollock. Though it might just create a black picture, so I might need a different artifact. 

Final Project Idea 2:
Topic: Twitch Chat
Question: How does the linguistics of twitch chat vary depending on time zone.
Significance: I'm not too sure about this, possibly to find out how the language and maturity changes at different times.

The reason that twitch chat interests me is that I've talked to a people who told me that it's an art form. It initially confused me but after further discussion they described how it allowed them to express themselves by either their own comments, or by copied pictures or emotes. So this would fit digital humanities, also I think this a new medium that doesn't have very much analytics on it. 

I'm not too sure about the artifact for this project. There is a subreddit on Reddit which has computer generated content by using data from specific subreddits. I'm not sure of the difficulty but if it was possible I would like to generate an average twitch comment.

Also one last idea I have if these don't qualify for the final project is to do an analysis on what type of videos go viral, such as subject and time posted.
