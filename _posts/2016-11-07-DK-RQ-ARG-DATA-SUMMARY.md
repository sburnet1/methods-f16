title: “Research Question, Argument, & Data Summary”
author: dkomarovo

The research project that I am conducting asks the question of: How does internet usage bridge the digital divide in the South Korean 
Republic? This is a significant question because it investigates a form of scholarly writing, as recommended by Professor Gregory C. 
Semenza, known as the “gap in scholarship.” This indicates that my specific research question has not been previously studied; at least 
not during enough occasions for it to have been thoroughly investigated. 

In attempting to provide closure to this research gap, I am arguing that: the growth of internet usage in the South Korean Republic has 
bridged the country’s digital divide. In the recent years, the success achieved by South Korea has become undeniable. The country is 
becoming increasing connected online with a national internet usage rate at 89.9% (World Bank, 2015). It is a rivalling the United States’
74.6%. But the South Korean federal government is not stopping there. They are steadily continuing their investments in providing internet 
services for further improvement, including but not limited to: rural, wireless, broadband, and gigabit connectivity (NYT, 2011). Not to 
mention that South Korea is home to enormous corporations as: LG, Samsung, and Hyundai. Also, the country set world records for the fastest 
internet speeds; a famous distinction and trademark of development and progression.

The data I am collecting in my project includes statistics provided by the World Bank, an international financial organization since 
1944, detailing national internet usage percentages of almost any country worldwide. Next, I consult financial documentation from 
MarketLine, from Datamonitor international corporation, which contains further statistics, as well as: charts, graphs, 
and network maps. Additionally, I found three articles (NYT, Wiley Online Library, and Forbes), as well as a research paper 
contrasting the DOI (Digital Opportunity Index) development in Botswana, in contrast to that of South Korea.

For this week’s assigned readings, the data summary from professor Kocurek and Nakamura’s research articles entails usage of: images, 
dates, existing projects, statistics, media, amongst other sources. Specifically professor Kocurek utilized tens of websites, articles, 
and videogames to reach the conclusion that videogame violence has become so commonplace in its widespread mediums that make it the norm.
Nakamura used social media, images, websites, and articles, which strengthened her claim that racialization is not only an existing issue
in MMO games, it is a persisting one. Overall, it is evident that the use of diverse forms of evidence can dramatically improve the 
success of one’s argument in their research endeavors.
