And now the moment you've all been waiting for...the final project, where videos and power points know no bounds.

Okay that may be a bit exaggerated but what isn't a little over the top these days, which actually brings us to the topic that we are looking to dicuss for our final project. Effective communication has become a daunting task, forcing people to decifer the important parts from the sarcasm and satire in media, social networking sites, and conversation.  The worst part is this goes without mentioning the language barriers in our global community in addition to the fact that we have begun to genarate a new digital texting laguage in the form of short hand acronyms, all of which makes comminication even more of an ordeal.  

With that we give you our final project:

Topic:
Effective communication in a digital world.

Question:
How can you effectively comminicate in an ever changing digital world?

Significance:
Language is falling apart the more digital we become and communication must become more effective in order to keep the information flow going and to keep moving forward.

Artifact:
We intend on making a short film on the guide lines of effective and ineffective communication and show what kind of impact this can have.
