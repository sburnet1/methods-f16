### Finals are upon us

#### Seriously though, like even more than last time!

So, I know my final project sounded amazing and we were going to uncover a whole new understanding of humans beings, but something just didn't sit well with Red and I. So, it's sad to say, we've changed our final project idea. Actually, our idea has changed a few times since the time of our last post, but we have finally made our final choice (fingers crossed!). 
In an effort to make things as interesting as we can for our project (while also being able to finish it by the end of the semester), we have decided to focus our project on pop music, and seeing how the use of vulgar language has changed since the 2000's. Surprising, with a quick Google search, there aren't many studies done questioning the rise of swearing in pop music, apart from rap music. So, we thought it would be interesting to see how, and if, swearing has increased in pop music today, and also see if a rise in the dirty language of pop music has influenced any other area of pop culture (or vice versa).
To accomplish this, we plan on gathering the lyrics for the top 10 songs of every year from 2000 to 2015 and comparing the amount of swear words used and the severity of the words (how we will determine this we have yet to find out). And instead of counting these words one at a time, we will utilize the power of computers to do all the work for us (because counting the wear words in 150 songs is a lot of counting), and use that data to see if we're onto something!
Our "thing" we will be creating to present our findings will be very entertaining, and we feel like keeping it a surprise will make it that more exciting!
On a final note, SPECIFICALLY FOR THE PROFESSOR, we would like to have our project due on the very last day of class, so we have as much time as needed to make our project great!
