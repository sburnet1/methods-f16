### The research question and argument of Booth 2013

Chapter 6, entitled *The First Time* of Paul Booth's [*Fan Phenomena: Doctor Who*] examines the first time fans of Doctor Who watched or experienced the show as a fan, and asks what these experiences have in common with and where they differ from each other.

**Research Question**
Booth aims to study the moments at which viewers of Doctor Who became fans (or *Whovians*) by examining the similarities and differences of their *first time* stories because, in doing so, it may be possible to discover what makes the show so special for its fans.

**Argument**
What ties these experiences together is that they are similarly unique and that, collectively, these experience comprise the fandom.
