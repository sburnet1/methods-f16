title: "Ideas for When You Don't Have an Idea"

This post like my glasses in eight grade, comes to you in two parts.

## Part 1: Mission Statement
Last time we learned a way to break down arguments in articles. We will be continuing to do this, for practice makes perfect. But we also want to implement what we study. 
Create our own research articles. 
Seems like a daunting task. What will we study and how will we do it? We already know how we are going to present our argument, by using a similar style of the research articles we broke down, and the lens of digital humanities. What we want to study is another idea entirely.

## Part 2: Another Idea Entirely
Whatever you research make sure you have a passion for it. You will be spending quite a lot of your time reading, writing and possibly watching your specific topic. I, myself, will be taking up a research topic. I have absolutely no idea what I am going to study. And if you are that same boat, trust me, you’re in great company.

If you’re going to be spending a lot of time on your paper, you might want to look at something you’ve already spent a lot of time on. Look to your passions. I love superheroes, fantasy, and nerd-culture.  My research topic will probably revolve around one of those topics. Most but not all of my exposure to my passions has been through either movies or TV shows. I would be interested in doing video analysis and writing a paper on what I found. Video analysis looks at how the creator uses visuals to create meaning. I’m interested to see what deeper level messages I will uncover in my favorite shows.

Pick a topic that is centered around something that you already have a passion for, but maybe you don't know everything about just yet.
