I still being a little confused with the final project, but there's what I thought I want to do for the final project.
Since we are allowed to work in groups, I'm willing to work with people who are interested in this topic.

## Research  Questions (topic, questions, significance, or/and application)
Topic: Racial differences in the job market in the U.S

Question: why situation (most of white collars are white people, and for the lower-income group, the blue collars, they are more tend to be black people and hispanic.) happens/shows in the U.S.?

Significance: What caused this situation and what to do to get balanced.

## Plan (data, process, method, timeline)

Data: collect from city (Chicago), then move on to Illinois, then the nation.

Process: Search internet first, maybe interview people, see how they are thinking, write them down, and analyze.

Method: needs to figure out. 

Timeline: needs to figure out in detail, but deadline is December 1st. 

## Artifact
Video, and the research paper.
