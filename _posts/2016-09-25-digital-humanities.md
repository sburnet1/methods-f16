  Digitial Humanities is a realtively new term that has come to light largely due to this  generations 
  advancements in technology and  social media. The term "Digial Humanities" is a very broad term that 
  encompasses many topics.
  
  One example that comes to mind when I think of Digital Humanities is, today you'll notice that physical 
  newspapers are in real danger of going out of business unless they can (or have already) make the transition
  to online news, which is constantly updating 24/7.
  
  In todays generation everything in connected by the internet. So all in all, Digital Humanities is just Humanities 
  that has been digitialized in an attempt to stay alive in todays technology driven world, just like the newspapers.
