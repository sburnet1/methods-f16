For our final project, Amina and I chose to test an experiment using the presidential candidates' twitters
and we are sticking to it. We have already compiled a week's data of tweets manually from both Hillary and
Trump. The results were predictable yet shocking.

We are now onto how to potray our data. We will most likely use a video but if any other better representation
occurs to us we will go with an alternative. Any suggestions welcome, but for now we got this one in the
bag.
