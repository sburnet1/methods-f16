**Completed Final Project Proposal**
The goal of my final project is to explore racial representation transitions throughout classic film. To do this, I will be analyzing the Star Wars movie series. This is important because representation, especially in media that has played a fundamental role in society and film, is important. People shape their ideas of others and off life from what they see and watch. 


In order to study this, I will take the scripts for every Star Wars movie and run them through a text analysis software programmed in Python. (current work in progress) I plan to define each character by the race of the person voicing them, and using this information I will collect data on how integral non-white characters are in the movies, and how this has changed throughout the years.


For my artifact, I will probably be creating an infographic of each film with a pie chart representing what percentage of the time non-white actors spoke.
