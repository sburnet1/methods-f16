#Fairy Tales have Become Badass
=

DAMN! Prince Charming isn't too bad with a sword and a baby in hand.  And still save the chosen one from the evil clutches of the witch.  The suspense of what will happen next is very nerve racking, setting up for a thrilling season. Before I keep on drowling on about the show(which i've watched up to season 2), I'll get back to the class.  

The point of watching Once Upon a Time for class, was to analyze it for studying networks.  More specificly network interactions(no, not facebook).  We were all to watch the episode, and record who spoke to who and who appeared with who on a given scene. 

Obviously this isn't easy crap to do for everyone, so we just split the work in half.  One half focused on the conversational interactions, the other half looked at appearances in a scene.  Hmmmm, which do you think was easiest?

Trying to record everytime someone says something to another person, and then the response immediatly following that, and get mesmorized by the episode that you stop writing because of the compelling story.  Lucky for me I have Netflix, which meant I went home and did my part(where I rewatched episodes 2 and 3 afterwards).

Now after looking at my notes that I took, I don't see much use to it.  Of course, you see that some characters have a bigger role in the show than others because they speak more, but theres nothing else that I was able to understand form the data.  When you are taking the data, there are also problems you face. Does every single person that utters a word get put in the data?  Do crowds count?  What if it's an extra that yells words out of camera sight?

If we look at who's in a scene with who, it's a lot easier to jot down but still doesn't give much depth as to what significance it has.

And that's what Red thinks.
