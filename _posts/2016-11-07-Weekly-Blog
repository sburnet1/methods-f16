##Research Question:

* Topic - The racialization of online communities such as World of Warcraft.

* Question - How does what ended up being made on Machinima impact and regard the attitudes of the World of Warcraft community

* Significance - The incident we review towards "chinese player workers" is extremely aggressive and it cannot be assumed to be only in World of Warcraft

##Argument:

* Claim - The world of warcraft community is not racist towards the "chinese player workers" as a whole, just some

* Reasons - Only the people who feel a certain way the most passionately, especially when they are negative feelings. This usually results in unwanted ranting in a way to remove certain types

* Evidence - Nakamura shows several cases in which other users do not agree which supports the claim listed

* Alternatives - ---

* Warrents - There are clear differences in opinion on whther or not the comments are just a part of the game or whether or not the users making said issues should be removed for ruining the game for others.
