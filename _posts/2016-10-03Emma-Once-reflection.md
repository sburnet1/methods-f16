Who is/are the main character(s), if you look just at the data?
It's very clear that Emma, Henry, and Snow White/ Mary Maragret Blanchard are the main characters. They had the most speaking lines and appeared the most in the episode.


What dyads (pairs of people) are likely to get interesting?
The relationship between Emma and Mary Maragret Blanchard will be the most interesting because we know what happened, but Emma is still clueless


Do you think the show’s “multiple world” settings will be reflected in the data? Why or why not?
I tried to mark the characters accordingly with the mutiple world setting, but it seems like that is going to get complicated really fast. I'm not sure how the series continues, but it seems like these parallel worlds will exist throughout the series. Therefore, it will probably be relfected in the data because even though the characters are technically the same, the settings are different enough to make a difference.
