title: Analysis Is EVERYWHERE

### I will analyze this blog, I will analyze this font, I will analyze... etc.

"When something has been done, there is something to analyze". This famous quote was said by no one other than me, Robert Judka (well it has the potential to be a famous quote if over the years, my blog is still alive and people start to realize just how deep the meaning of my quote is, jk). But, just to prepare for the future, I will state it as a famous quote.

Irregardless (yes I'm using the word again!), it truly is amazing how we have the ability to pick everything apart to its core, and see exactly how the little bits and pieces of it can affect millions of different things. From reading both Carly Kocurek's "The Agony and the Exidy: A History of Video Game Violence and the Legacy of Death Race", and the study "Sensitive Self-disclosures, Responses, and Social Support on Instagram: the Case of #Depression" by Nazanin Andalibi, Pinar Ozturk, and Andrea Forte, I learned that everything from social media to video games can be scholarly analyzed, and we can even analyze those analyses (analysi?) to see exactly what they are trying to uncover or argue or what their intentions are!! Pretty crazy stuff I know.

One thing I found particularly difficult about breaking down a study was finding the main claim and reasons. (also reading the articles were pretty hard but that will be a whole different blog post (I only kid, I know how to read!)). While doing some in class activities, I found myself getting lost in the words of the authors, and couldn't really found one single sentence to be used as the "main claim". Instead, I kept finding little miniscule details, but kept thinking they were the claims. I'm not sure why this was such a problem for me, but everything sentence seemed to be an argument for some reason. Maybe that is true, but it really messed me up when trying to figure out the main claim.

One of the most overwhelming things for me when analyzing these works, was first of all they were really long, and just looking at the first paragraph for the thesis didn't seem like enough. I feel like in all the classes I've taken in college so far, well the ones that required writing and analyzing papers, there were always different factors to look for when doing a complete analysis. And so far, analyzing claims, warrants and reasons seems to be the most difficult for me.
