title: The Largest Polygraphic Film Analysis Ever Conducted

After analyzing a whopping 2,000 scripts, 25,000 actors, and 4 million lines (not by me but from the research of Hanah Anderson 
& Matt Daniels), conclusions about sexism in cinema could be made with much greater confidence. Prior to gathering serious
data, it was known that "white men dominate movie roles" ("The Largest Analysis of Film Dialogue by Gender, Ever.” ). Through 
conducting the “...largest undertaking of script analysis, ever” ("The Largest Analysis...” ), the collected data revealed a 
certain trend. The statistics are as follows: 22 of 30 Disney films have mostly male dialogue, Mushu has 50% more words to say
than Mulan, 99.5% male dialogue in Schindler’s List, Pretty Woman 52% male dialogue, 10 Things I Hate About You 52% male 
dialogue, romantic comedies 58% male dialogue, 22% of all films have lead female actress(es), women rank second for most
dialogue in 34% of films, women occupying 2 of top 3 roles in a film at 18%, meaning that men occupy 2 of top 3 roles in 
82% of films. Role availibility was found to be opposite between women and men. As women age over 40, less roles are available. 
Yet men have the opportunity to pursue more roles as they age age. Clearly, cinema is male dominated. Now you can display 
stronger arguments to your friends!

The authors conducted this investigation to compensate for the unreliable and controversial Bechdel Test. Through the measure
of dialogue, a solid objective view is constructed. This allows for greater reliability and validity in argumentation. 
Through this unprecedented research performance, statements as: “you know...women are never love-interests when they’re 
older than 40. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯” (“The Largest Analysis…”), can be better understood.
