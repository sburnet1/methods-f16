What is the final topic to write about? And how do I write about it. 

The time to choose what to blog about for our final review is here, and I have spent the entire past week trying to figure out what to block about, and have had little to no luck figuring things out. But leave it to me to think of something at the very absolutely last second. 
So I have an idea but I have no idea how to go about it now. Thank you to Libby for structuring our final blog by giving having us submit a Topic, Question, and Purpose. That is all very helpful, but from last week, I don't know entirely how to make the question and purpose to then analyses my data. We did talk how some people work backwards, but I feel that gets confusing because you don't really know what you are doing with the data so you can’t really be going forwards. 
That is a neat idea though. Seems kind of fitting for someone who does everything at the last second. Analyze all the data, pull it all together, not really answering the question or having a purpose. Then, all of a sudden, after standing one step past the starting line, you turn around and there’s the finish. The data all leads up to the question. The answer is presented to form the question that data has made. You did all the work and went nowhere, just to turn it all into something a lot bigger then you had any idea with.

It’s kind of like that story of how Thomas Edison took a hundred tries to make the lightbulb, and everyone criticized him for doing it wrong so many times. Then he just responds that he figured out 99 ways to not make a light bulb. I'm sure that shut them up. Kind of a "Screw you I did what I did and it worked all 99 times, the 100th was just a lot cooler"

So I don't know my question or purpose, but I have an idea. So let’s see if I can turn that idea around.

As we went through a lot of text analysis, I want to keep with that. We also evaluated the amount each gender was active in pilot episodes of two well-known television shows. I think it would be interesting to combine them now. 
I want to look up the top 5 books of each year for the past decade, and find out the percentage of male vs female roles in each. Then compare the ratio of male/female characters to how highly it was placed for that year.
So that will be my data. My topic I would say is "Male vs. Female Roles in top literature for the past decade". Right?
As for my question, I'm not sure. I’m going to try the work backwards approach. Yet I will start with one to initially go with in hopes of answering. But I will have no issue changing it later on to fit my data to successfully complete this blog. Even if I fail in answering the initial question. So my initial question will be: “What effect of the male vs female ratio in literature has on its ranking as a top novel of the year.”

As for a purpose, I need to answer what this is for. Simply I would say that the purpose of all of this expresses how more male or female roles influence the likelihood of a novel being more favored and ranked by society. 

So what do you think? Yes, I know there are a few standards to work out. What is a top book? By who’s standards? All that stuff. So I’ll have to work that out, but I think it could all work out.
