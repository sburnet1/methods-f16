Even though this is posted super late, this is what I had written down for the post, back in the beginnings...

#So it begins huh?

I am most interested in abnormal research styles. Abnormal? Yeah, what happens when you can't just google something or go to the library and find the answer.  What happens then?

I am most interested in the technology advancements relating to the rise of digital humanities.  This being most media, web presences, and anything relating to cool things as a result of technology making it possible. 

Also, learning and mastering transmedia navigation, collective intelligence, multitasking, performance, and simulation.  Yes, I know, almost all, but I take my learning seriously.  I never know when something may be just what I need, I want to be prepared.
