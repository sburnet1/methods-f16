What we've learned last week was the coding about data analize and a peer review on our previous assignments. I didn't get to had a lot of chance talking about my blog posts as there is some tec issue that my post wasn't upload successfully. But through reading about the other's post, I figured that my blogs are usually too short. For my final product, I would like to write some code for analizing methods. I'm wondering if I can create a algorithm calculating the method of the sentences. I should be able to use social network as the resourse of learning. And once it's complete, I will be able to use it on analizing of different literatures. I don't yet know what kind of conclution it can come up with yet, may be it can be used to calculate the style of the author and judge if another paragraph is wrote by him/her or not. May be we can use it to help us find out the author we like and help us pick the books with the styles we like. But no matter how, I've to learn about the analoize coding now.
