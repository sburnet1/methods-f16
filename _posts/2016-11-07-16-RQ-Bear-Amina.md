Claim: The video game/movie, Death Race, is a very violent game, and has a negative
impact on society due to its suggestive themes.

Reasons to support claim: Driessen states how nearly 9,000 pedestrians were killed in the past year, mostly in driving accidents. ESRB mentioned how only 5% of the games rated by the board were given a "Mature" rating, but five of the top ten popular games that year were rated M (Narcisse, 2011)

Evidence from text: In the text, the author appears to take a neutral stance, however, 
a closer look reveals the negative connotation throughout the reading. The autor uses words 
such as "violence" and "dangerous". In addition to this, the reader discusses consistently
how the violent gaming goes beyond the realm of the tv screen, and appears to affect the 
lives of everybody playing/ watching the game/movie. 



July 2011, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in Brown v. Entertainment
Merchants Association that video games qualify for the same free speech protections that cover other forms of expression

Death Race is a violent race across country that kills people.

Death Race was not an isolated incident of violent gaming; it existed in a field littered
with competitor games with equally violent premises.
