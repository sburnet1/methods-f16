For the final project we will be working in a group of two. My partner will be Julian Escasa. Our final project is subject to change as to better utilize our skills with another research question. 

Question:
At a tech school which has a majority of male students, is there an unproportional amount of males asking questions during class versus females?

To measure this we will use an audio recorded and record multiple lectures and then analyze the amount of male talkers versus female talkers during that said lecture. After enough lectures have been recorded and analyzed we should have a good representation of the ratio.

The final project will include a write up of the data analyzed as well as a visual representation to help better understand the data that was recorded.
