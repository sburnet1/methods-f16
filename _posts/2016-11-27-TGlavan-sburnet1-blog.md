WE ARE DONE

Well not quite but we finished the filming this saturday and steve is in the process of editing.

As far as research goes we have found several sites with lists of various texting and gaming SMS acronyms.  However none of these are from a credible source or an academic journal, but I am unsure if we really need it to be.

Estimated completion date: December 2, 2016
