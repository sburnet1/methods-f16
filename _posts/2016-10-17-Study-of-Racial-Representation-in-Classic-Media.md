author: rbrooks6

For my final project, I plan to make an infographic representing the changes in diversity over various seasons of Saturday Night Live. I chose this because I want to study if popular classic television shows are getting more or less diverse, this is important, because popular television has a strong influence on culture as a whole. 

This idea is in itâ€™s beginning stages. I have also been considering studying another long-running show like Friends instead, or doing some sort of a racial timer for speaking characters on a classic movie like Star Wars.

**Research Question:** 

*Topic:* Diversity in popular tv show (SNL)

*Question:* How has the cast of SNL changed culturally over the years?

*Significance:* representation and diversity is important, especially in popular classics like SNL.

**Plan:** Survey the cast of SNL from the time that it began to today and study trends in percentage of multicultural cast, to white cast.

**Kind of Artifact:** Infographic
