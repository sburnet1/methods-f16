title: "On Rhetoric"

This weak's reading, *Section III* in [The Craft of Research](https://www.amazon.com/Research-Chicago-Writing-Editing-Publishing/dp/0226065669) provides an accessible and concise introduction to rhetoric (in the Aristotelian sense of the word). This is a subject that's been on my mind a lot, lately, primarily because so much of the discourse generated by this election cycle seems to be lacking of evidence and warrants (and sometimes even reasons), and acknowledgement of objection and alternative views often takes the form of personal or ad hominem attacks (not to mention the scapegoating of [Mexicans](http://forward.com/opinion/319838/donald-trump-and-the-dangers-of-scapegoating/), [muslims](http://www.npr.org/2016/06/05/480861394/muslims-are-just-the-latest-in-history-of-scapegoats-author-says), [jews](http://www.aol.com/article/2016/10/10/alt-right-blames-jews-for-donald-trumps-debate-flop/21578228/), and ["the media"](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/10/16/trump-blames-a-media-conspiracy-for-women-opposing-him-he-should-blame-himself/)). Increasingly, we're seeing [public declarations by *elected officials*](http://www.forbes.com/forbes/welcome/?toURL=http://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2016/08/05/newt-gingrich-exemplifies-just-how-unscientific-america-is/&refURL=https://www.google.com/&referrer=https://www.google.com/) that *facts* (evidence) are irrelevant and can be ignored when they provide objective support for a reality that's contrary to one's *feelings.* It's not just our elected officials, of course - I'm sure most of us have at least one Facebook friend who's convinced that the *mere existence* of the [recent WikiLeaks dump](http://www.npr.org/2016/10/22/498954190/wikileaks-dump-method-destroys-privacy-sociologist-says-not-all-leaked-pass-publ) *proves* that Secretary Clinton is a criminal (because InfoWars says so and also because otherwise, why would they have bothered to hack a private citizen's email and publicly release the stolen information?). Of course, this isn't a new trend. It's been going on for awhile now, and many people have been talking about [America's problem with science](https://www.amazon.com/Republican-War-Science-Chris-Mooney/dp/0465046762/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1477328761&sr=1-1&keywords=republican+war+on+science) and [critical thinking](https://www.amazon.com/Republican-Brain-Science-Science-Reality/dp/1118094514/ref=pd_bxgy_14_2?ie=UTF8&pd_rd_i=1118094514&pd_rd_r=R5YRF3FXCF5QYTC4P0ZQ&pd_rd_w=sr3av&pd_rd_wg=UoXCw&psc=1&refRID=R5YRF3FXCF5QYTC4P0ZQ) for a number of years.

For those of us who have read this week's reading and/or who have some experience with rhetoric, it's pretty easy to pick out a good claim backed by warranted reasons for which relevant evidence exists and a completely bogus claim made out of fear and/or one's personal desire for the claim to be true. And it's unsettling that so many of us so easily accept things as true simply because they're said loudly (I'm looking at you, [Alex Jones](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/alex-jones)); also, for an explanation of why this is actually true in some cases, check out the [Elaboration Likelihood Model of persuasion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elaboration_likelihood_model). In less personal and less emotional situations, people might care that their rhetoric adversely affects their *ethos.* But in some circles, it seems like having a strong *ethos* is devalued and signifies that one is in cahoots with the ominous and amorphous (or sometimes, as mentioned above, a single group used as a scapegoat) enemy. When people don't care about their reputation, nor their logic, it's nearly impossible to reason with them. Some of you might have first-hand experience with this. For instance, I have this one frustrating Facebook friend who uses a line about "flawed college campus rhetoric" as an attempt to end conversations in which evidence that runs contrary to his views (which are typically sexist, heterosexist, ethnocentric/xenophobic, racist, etc) is presented, which is ironic considering that his discourse, consisting solely of opinions with no support, is entirely free of any rhetoric whatsoever... It's possible (sometimes) to get through in these situations, though, but it's a complicated and arduous undertaking that requires ample amounts of tact and patience. (And, arguably, despite it being difficult to do so, those of us capable of picking out bad rhetoric, articulating its flaws, and clearly communicating objective findings to the contrary have a responsibility to do so.)
