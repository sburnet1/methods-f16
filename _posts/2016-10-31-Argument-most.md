For our final project, Amina and I are contiuing our research on the presidential candidates' 
campaigns. We have already compiled a week's data of tweets manually from both Hillary and
Trump over the course of a single week.

Our argument can't be comparing tweets from other elections, due to the selection of data.
Therefore, we have chosen to argue that the majority of tweets from each presidential candidate
are of bashing/criticism in nature. Obviously, Donald Trump has more tweets bashing others, including his 
own party. Hillary, however, had a much lower bashing rate, and for some reason seems to be obsessed 
with Michelle Obama.

We will continue to resolve what this all means and how it should be used. So far, our argument is that the 
majority of tweets are criticism, and the results tend to support our claim.
