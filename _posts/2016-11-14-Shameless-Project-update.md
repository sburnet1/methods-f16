To most accurately evaluate how Lip’s upbringing has impacted how he makes (important) decisions in his life and how his social 
background effects that as well, we have decided to focus on the years that Lip attends college (Season 4-6). By creating a network, 
following Lip, in the episodes for seasons 4-6, we can follow how his social interactions and background shape what kind of person 
he is. To determine how those social interactions and backgrounds affect the decisions he makes, we’ll look at the major events that
occur within this time period that alter Lips life in either a positive or negative way. 
In addition, we’ve also created a survey with questions related to our topic. We’ve asked other Shameless viewers their opinion and 
thoughts regarding nature vs. nurture, Lip’s social interactions, and how they think his upbringing has affected the way he makes 
decisions as a grown up.
