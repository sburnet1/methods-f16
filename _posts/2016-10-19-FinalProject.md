title: Maddi and Emma's Final Project Idea
author: ezachock

Maddi and I have decided to work together on the final project for many reasons, but specifically because we both love the Showtime show Shameless. It is an easily relatable show taking place on the southside of Chicago and showing real life family issues such as mental illness, finances, and love. 

We currently are not sure exactly what we want to study on this topic, but we are thinking something we can create into a video for our final deliverable.
