Once Upon A Time is the story of modern life and fairy tales colliding. But just like in every fairy tale story, it still has the basic
fundamental elements of a fairy tale. Royalty vs. poverty, magic and enchantment, and most obviously good vs. evil. Thats where the
communities within the TV series begin to form. 

	Your good vs. evil characters, the Evil Queen vs. Snow White and Prince Charming. Typical fairy tale rivalries are portrayed in the real
  world, but the real world has also created new rivalries such as Emma Swan and Regina (The Evil Queen). When fairy tales meet reality,
  you never know what is going to happen in the small town of Storybrook. 
  
	Enter Emma Swan and Henry Mills, who aren’t in any modern day fair tales, but both have very significant impacts on the surrounding
  communities. Emma is a bull headed protagonist who doesn’t know the meaning of the word ‘no’. And Henry is a determined little boy who
  see’s past all of the Evil Queen’s enchantments. With the addition of these two characters, you suddenly have a new rivalry between
  Regina and Emma, as Regina competes with Emma for Henry’s affection. 
  
	Regina, who is the The Evil Queen in fairy tale books, is also the Mayor of Storybrook. In today’s society, government figures are
  perceived as corrupt and overall in a negative light just like in her role in the books.
  
	Then, there is Mr. Gold, who is Rumplestiltskin in the fair tale books. He is scheming and tricky. According to the people of Storybook,
  Mr. Gold “owns this town”. Which in reality means he represents the part of society who does things ‘under the table’ or ‘above the
  law’. Which is viewed as criminal activity. In the beginning of the “Pilot” episode, Rumplstilltskin is locked away in a cell.
	In conclusion, whether it’s in a fairy tale book or in reality, good vs. evil is always a prominent reality.
