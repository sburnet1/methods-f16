Sexism. Harry Potter.  Why would anyone ever think that these two words have something in common? Well turns out that
the book series(aswell as the movies) are pretty damn good at making the female characters inferior to the guys.  I personally
have only seen 2 of the movies, when I was 12, and haven't read any of the books.  So the little knowledge I have of the series
didn't yell to me "SEXIST".

Looking at the way that the two authors, Heilman and Donaldson, go about "investigating" the Potter books, to me seems a bit over
done.  They put too much meaning into some of the ideas that come up in the books.  Like for example, J.K.Rowling put 115 female 
but a wooaping 205 men as characters.  Holy mackarel!!!  How J.K.Rowling add more female characters at the end.  Clear evidence
of sexism!

I honestly don't see it, but again I haven't completly read the books.  When I read a book called something like "One Rough Man" 
or "Wolf Man", I expect that the author is going to have a cast of largley male characters.  Of course there should be some female
characters that support the main character.  I don't believe thats sexist, it's just the expectations that most people have.  

In today's world it seems like every thing that is writen, recording, said, etc. has to be appropriate for each and every
audience.  J.K.Rowling's books have to be completly equal to both men and women, seems to be with various media.

Now I am not saying that equality it bad, it's great.  But when different types of media are forced to change any thing that
is too radical,  how creative can people get without being blocked down?  

I understand that children and young adults are reading the Harry Potter series, with very impresionable minds.  But they 
shouldn't be shielded from opposing ideas, or negative ones.  They should be able to know what they think is appropriate in
the world.  

Historians like to compare the rise and fall of empires to climbing a slope with bare feet, but falling down with silk slippers.
The struggle to success is extremely hard, but once they get there they soften up and begin to fall.  The American society 
seems to be to delicate to ideas that our ancestors 1 or 2 generations ago would just shrug off.

And that's what Red thinks.
