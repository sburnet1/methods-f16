1
00:00:05,807 --> 00:00:08,638
My name is Kara Zor-El.

2
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,688
24 years ago my planet, Krypton,

3
00:00:11,689 --> 00:00:13,326
was in serious peril.

4
00:00:13,326 --> 00:00:15,170
My cousin, Kal-El,

5
00:00:15,172 --> 00:00:19,449
was sent to a planet called Earth
for his own safety and protection.

6
00:00:23,355 --> 00:00:26,001
You may know his story.

7
00:00:35,137 --> 00:00:39,590
The story you don't know is
that I was sent to protect him.

8
00:00:45,146 --> 00:00:47,789
Your pod's coordinates are
interlocked with Kal-El's.

9
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:50,829
- You will follow him to Earth.
- I'm not afraid, Father.

10
00:00:51,853 --> 00:00:54,329
The trip is long but
you'll sleep most of the way

11
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:56,353
and we'll be with you in your dreams.

12
00:00:56,353 --> 00:00:59,843
You'll journey to Earth to look
after your baby cousin, Kal-El.

13
00:00:59,844 --> 00:01:01,469
Because of the Earth's yellow sun,

14
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:03,726
you'll have great powers on this planet.

15
00:01:03,728 --> 00:01:06,402
You will do extraordinary things.

16
00:01:06,403 --> 00:01:09,641
I won't fail Kal-El or you.

17
00:01:22,929 --> 00:01:24,807
I love you, Kara.

18
00:01:26,305 --> 00:01:28,388
You must go, now.

19
00:01:37,811 --> 00:01:39,290
Go!

20
00:01:55,299 --> 00:01:59,383
Things didn't exactly go
according to my mother's plan.

21
00:02:04,853 --> 00:02:07,540
Krypton's destruction sent a shock wave

22
00:02:07,542 --> 00:02:11,608
that knocked my pod off course
and into the Phantom Zone.

23
00:02:12,525 --> 00:02:15,390
A region in space where time doesn't pass.

24
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,914
I slept there for 24 years...

25
00:02:18,915 --> 00:02:21,194
until somehow I got here.

26
00:02:22,721 --> 00:02:25,939
When I arrived, I was
still a 13-year-old girl.

27
00:02:25,941 --> 00:02:29,141
But in that same time my
cousin Kal-El had grown up

28
00:02:29,143 --> 00:02:31,550
and revealed himself to your world...

29
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:33,180
as Superman.

30
00:02:33,182 --> 00:02:36,250
The most powerful man in the universe.

31
00:02:37,223 --> 00:02:39,855
My cousin wanted me to
have the same safe...

32
00:02:39,856 --> 00:02:41,687
human-type of childhood he did.

33
00:02:41,688 --> 00:02:45,932
So he placed me with my
adoptive family, the Danvers.

34
00:02:46,087 --> 00:02:50,355
Scientists who once helped him
understand his own super abilities.

35
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:53,825
I know I'm not your mom, sweetheart.

36
00:02:53,826 --> 00:02:55,658
But you're safe here.

37
00:02:58,667 --> 00:03:01,112
They had a daughter, Alex.

38
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:03,338
And despite being born
on different planets,

39
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:05,004
we both shared one thing:

40
00:03:05,006 --> 00:03:08,490
we knew our lives would
never be the same again.

41
00:03:09,165 --> 00:03:12,628
My cousin... he didn't need my protection.

42
00:03:13,876 --> 00:03:16,161
I didn't have a mission anymore.

43
00:03:17,498 --> 00:03:20,939
But even though I had all
the same powers he did...

44
00:03:20,941 --> 00:03:22,747
Sorry, sorry.

45
00:03:22,748 --> 00:03:25,631
I decided the best thing
I could do is fit in.

46
00:03:27,114 --> 00:03:28,747
After all...

47
00:03:28,748 --> 00:03:31,236
Earth didn't need another hero.

48
00:03:31,237 --> 00:03:34,239
I need two tickets in the
Orchestra section for Wicked.

49
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,313
No, not for Ms. Grant,
her mother wants to see it.

50
00:03:37,314 --> 00:03:40,932
Yes, again. Sure, I'll hold.

51
00:03:40,933 --> 00:03:42,383
Charlie?

52
00:03:42,384 --> 00:03:44,257
I'm calling about the
Correspondent's dinner,

53
00:03:44,258 --> 00:03:48,280
I need to make sure Ms. Grant doesn't
end up next to Bill O'Riley again.

54
00:03:48,281 --> 00:03:51,096
I work at CatCo Worldwide Media.

55
00:03:51,097 --> 00:03:54,778
An online and print empire
built by my boss, Cat Grant.

56
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:58,021
The most powerful woman in National City.

57
00:03:58,022 --> 00:04:01,044
At least... for the next few days.

58
00:04:01,045 --> 00:04:04,129
Did you see this? There was an
armored car robbery last night.

59
00:04:04,131 --> 00:04:06,405
There were no witnesses
except for this homeless guy

60
00:04:06,406 --> 00:04:08,616
who swears the perp had horns.

61
00:04:09,144 --> 00:04:11,224
Like... on his head!

62
00:04:11,225 --> 00:04:13,241
I'm telling you, they're out there: aliens!

63
00:04:13,242 --> 00:04:15,701
Winn, there's no such thing as aliens.

64
00:04:15,703 --> 00:04:18,137
Well, you might feel different
if you read this website.

65
00:04:18,139 --> 00:04:21,805
- You write that website.
- I... I contribute.

66
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:25,745
Hey, um, I was wondering
if maybe you wanna...

67
00:04:25,747 --> 00:04:27,776
I don't know, go see a movie tonight.

68
00:04:27,778 --> 00:04:30,608
I... I can't. I'm sorry.

69
00:04:31,264 --> 00:04:32,937
I have a date.

70
00:04:34,132 --> 00:04:36,420
- Date, really?
- Uhm.

71
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:39,860
That's great... fun. Dating is fun.

72
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:43,069
- Who... who is that with?
- It's an online date.

73
00:04:43,646 --> 00:04:47,108
Says we are 82% compatible, so...

74
00:04:47,108 --> 00:04:48,533
should be good.

75
00:04:48,533 --> 00:04:51,790
You know that you can't quantify
emotions based on an algorithm?

76
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:54,992
Winn, you are IT, isn't your
whole life based on algorithms?

77
00:04:54,994 --> 00:04:58,651
Yes, so if there was an algorithm for
love I think that I would know about it.

78
00:04:58,651 --> 00:05:00,916
It's just that... you're gonna
know when it hits you, Kara.

79
00:05:00,918 --> 00:05:03,148
It'll be all: "pa-pow".

80
00:05:05,867 --> 00:05:08,119
Ugh, this elevator is a human petri dish,

81
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,185
it's like standing up in coach.

82
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:12,807
- She's here.
- How do you do that?

83
00:05:14,211 --> 00:05:15,624
Good morning, Ms. Grant.

84
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:17,276
The only reason I bought this building

85
00:05:17,278 --> 00:05:19,552
was because it had a private elevator.

86
00:05:19,552 --> 00:05:22,233
That way, I don't have to get soaked
in cheap cologne every morning,

87
00:05:22,233 --> 00:05:24,093
getting to my office, find out who used it,

88
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:26,778
have them reprimanded, or
bathed, I don't care which...

89
00:05:26,779 --> 00:05:28,781
Here's your latte. Hot.

90
00:05:30,442 --> 00:05:32,262
That would be new and different.

91
00:05:32,961 --> 00:05:34,793
I have a meeting with
the Board today at lunch,

92
00:05:34,795 --> 00:05:36,827
so cancel sushi with my mother.

93
00:05:36,829 --> 00:05:38,478
Oh, and cancel my therapist.

94
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,911
I won't be needing it if I'm
not having lunch with my mother.

95
00:05:40,913 --> 00:05:42,362
Got it.

96
00:05:44,178 --> 00:05:45,846
Also...

97
00:05:45,848 --> 00:05:47,461
I've emailed a list.

98
00:05:47,463 --> 00:05:51,310
Prepare termination letters for
the Tribune employees as noted.

99
00:05:51,312 --> 00:05:53,737
I realise that there are quite a few.

100
00:05:53,737 --> 00:05:55,750
But it would be so nice
if you handwrote them.

101
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,754
Use the lesser card stock.

102
00:05:57,754 --> 00:06:00,009
You're downsizing the Tribune?

103
00:06:00,886 --> 00:06:02,774
But that was your first acquisition.

104
00:06:02,774 --> 00:06:05,783
Go see if the new art
director has the layout ready.

105
00:06:07,093 --> 00:06:08,709
It's not that I don't see your frown,

106
00:06:08,711 --> 00:06:12,129
it's just that I don't care
enough to ask why it's there.

107
00:06:13,752 --> 00:06:17,033
All those people... they're
going to lose their jobs.

108
00:06:17,858 --> 00:06:21,495
What's going to happen to
them, to their families?

109
00:06:21,495 --> 00:06:24,329
They don't have to downsize
at the Daily Planet.

110
00:06:25,045 --> 00:06:28,302
Metropolis has a person who wears a cape...

111
00:06:28,303 --> 00:06:31,507
and flies around performing heroic acts.

112
00:06:32,031 --> 00:06:35,720
The Planet puts this
superlative man on their cover

113
00:06:35,721 --> 00:06:37,980
54% of the time.

114
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:42,255
You wanna save the Trib'?
Go find me a hero, Kira.

115
00:06:44,314 --> 00:06:45,795
Kara.

116
00:06:47,822 --> 00:06:49,226
Hello?

117
00:06:51,324 --> 00:06:53,762
- Hello?
- I'll be just a minute.

118
00:06:53,882 --> 00:06:57,316
Ms. Grant sent me for layouts
and she doesn't like to wait.

119
00:06:57,435 --> 00:06:59,115
She can wait a minute.

120
00:06:59,634 --> 00:07:01,329
Have you met Ms. Grant?

121
00:07:01,355 --> 00:07:04,778
Yeah, what is she gonna do?
Fire me right after hiring me?

122
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:06,826
Her loss.

123
00:07:09,968 --> 00:07:11,396
Hey.

124
00:07:12,288 --> 00:07:13,975
I'm the new guy.

125
00:07:19,752 --> 00:07:22,024
Oh, it's him!

126
00:07:23,117 --> 00:07:25,985
I've seen this picture
like a million times.

127
00:07:26,016 --> 00:07:27,867
It won the Pulitzer.

128
00:07:27,869 --> 00:07:29,742
- Wow.
- Yeah...

129
00:07:29,744 --> 00:07:31,817
Only 'cause it was the
first real shot of him.

130
00:07:31,817 --> 00:07:34,202
Little secret: he actually posed for that.

131
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:36,090
I guess he likes me.

132
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:40,377
Oh, my God, you're Jimmy Olson.

133
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:42,281
The photographer from the Daily Planet.

134
00:07:42,281 --> 00:07:43,819
James Olson.

135
00:07:44,444 --> 00:07:46,711
Well, Jimmy is reserved
for my mom and the big guy.

136
00:07:46,915 --> 00:07:48,387
He's kind of stuck in his ways.

137
00:07:48,649 --> 00:07:51,401
Uhm, I know what I've read, but...

138
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:55,173
What's he like in real life?

139
00:07:56,098 --> 00:07:57,497
He is

140
00:07:57,795 --> 00:07:59,872
everything you wanted to be and more.

141
00:08:00,992 --> 00:08:02,843
I was scared to move out here,

142
00:08:03,038 --> 00:08:06,440
but he told me the biggest
risk is never taking any, so...

143
00:08:09,942 --> 00:08:11,665
- Take it.
- Uhm?

144
00:08:12,615 --> 00:08:15,887
- Take it.
- This? Really? Oh God, no, I can't.

145
00:08:15,887 --> 00:08:19,593
- I can't...
- It's just a print. Please, take it.

146
00:08:20,026 --> 00:08:22,110
But first you have to tell me who you are.

147
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,297
- I never got your name.
- Oh...

148
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:28,870
Gosh... Hi.

149
00:08:31,747 --> 00:08:32,989
Kara.

150
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:34,418
Kara Danvers.

151
00:08:34,443 --> 00:08:35,638
Kara...

152
00:08:37,739 --> 00:08:39,441
Anyone ever tell you that you look

153
00:08:39,664 --> 00:08:41,153
a little like him right here?

154
00:08:43,744 --> 00:08:44,932
No.

155
00:08:46,113 --> 00:08:48,322
No, no you're the first.

156
00:08:50,664 --> 00:08:53,375
- Thank you very much.
- Yeah, of course.

157
00:08:53,864 --> 00:08:55,072
Uhm...

158
00:08:55,706 --> 00:08:57,177
Layouts.

159
00:08:58,445 --> 00:08:59,746
Right.

160
00:09:00,168 --> 00:09:01,754
Almost forgot them.

161
00:09:01,772 --> 00:09:02,970
Bye.

162
00:09:06,144 --> 00:09:07,510
"Pa-pow".

163
00:09:12,697 --> 00:09:15,787
I have a conference in Geneva and
I need to be on a plane in 2 hours.

164
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:17,543
And I have a blind date in half an hour

165
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:19,341
and I need you to help
me pick out what to wear.

166
00:09:19,394 --> 00:09:21,309
- I win.
- Why do you do this to me?

167
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:23,855
'Cause I'm your sister and you love me.

168
00:09:24,118 --> 00:09:27,426
I don't know, I feel like I'm
not living up to my potential.

169
00:09:27,469 --> 00:09:29,058
I went to work for Cat Grant

170
00:09:29,063 --> 00:09:31,076
because I thought
working in a media company

171
00:09:31,107 --> 00:09:34,017
run by a powerful woman who
actually shapes the way people think

172
00:09:34,053 --> 00:09:36,403
would be the way that I could
make a difference, but...

173
00:09:36,523 --> 00:09:37,523
instead I just

174
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,456
fetch layouts and coffee.

175
00:09:39,576 --> 00:09:41,909
You always wanted to be normal, right?

176
00:09:41,951 --> 00:09:45,707
So, having a crappy boss and
absolutely nothing to wear...

177
00:09:46,077 --> 00:09:49,615
- This is what normal looks like.
- I am not normal!

178
00:09:49,636 --> 00:09:51,706
I have the same powers he does.

179
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:54,865
I can lift a bus, stop a bullet,

180
00:09:54,886 --> 00:09:56,669
Alex, I can fly!

181
00:09:57,432 --> 00:10:00,804
At least I think I can, I
haven't done it in years.

182
00:10:01,043 --> 00:10:02,101
Kara...

183
00:10:02,695 --> 00:10:04,157
You've got a good job,

184
00:10:04,385 --> 00:10:05,385
you're cute,

185
00:10:05,504 --> 00:10:07,101
and thanks to your alien DNA

186
00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:08,674
you can't get pimples.

187
00:10:08,996 --> 00:10:10,822
Life is not so bad.

188
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:13,485
But, if you really wanna help somebody,

189
00:10:13,917 --> 00:10:17,370
you'll pick between one of these
two so I can get on my plane.

190
00:10:19,504 --> 00:10:20,923
- Yep.
- Good choice.

191
00:10:20,956 --> 00:10:22,860
When in doubt, go with
blue, it is your color.

192
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:23,892
All right...

193
00:10:24,304 --> 00:10:25,792
Text me every detail from your date

194
00:10:25,807 --> 00:10:27,735
and I will call you when
I'm back from Geneva.

195
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:29,368
- I love you.
- Love you.

196
00:10:39,455 --> 00:10:41,597
So, where are you from originally?

197
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:43,734
Like where was I born?

198
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:45,750
Uhm, north.

199
00:10:49,006 --> 00:10:50,821
I gotta hit this back real quick.

200
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:55,982
Check please.

201
00:10:56,548 --> 00:10:57,995
Make sure your number is on it.

202
00:11:00,397 --> 00:11:02,669
- If you're just joining us...
- Turn that up!

203
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:06,707
National City Airlines
flight 237, bound for Geneva,

204
00:11:06,827 --> 00:11:09,379
is experiencing some loss of altitude.

205
00:11:09,634 --> 00:11:13,759
The pilot seems to be circling the
city after apparent engine failure.

206
00:11:14,283 --> 00:11:17,148
Did he say Geneva? Alex.

207
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:08,500
We just lost another engine.
Mayday, mayday, mayday.

208
00:12:27,769 --> 00:12:31,239
We are going down. I
repeat, we are going down.

209
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,673
Flight attendants, brace for impact.

210
00:12:56,466 --> 00:12:58,292
We're leveling off.

211
00:13:02,701 --> 00:13:05,210
Oh, come on!

212
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,299
<b>transcribed and synced by AJ</b>

213
00:14:22,051 --> 00:14:25,711
The passengers of flight 237
appear to have a guardian angel

214
00:14:25,711 --> 00:14:29,683
when what many report to
be a female flying form

215
00:14:29,719 --> 00:14:31,745
rescued them from certain death.

216
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:34,024
Lena Winn is live at the scene.

217
00:14:34,049 --> 00:14:37,338
Thank you, Rick. Guardian
angel or human wrecking ball?

218
00:14:37,346 --> 00:14:40,087
- What?
- There is destruction all over Otto Binder Bridge.

219
00:14:40,113 --> 00:14:41,332
And one quick...

220
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:44,434
Well, you try saving a plane for the
first time. See if you don't make a mess.

221
00:14:45,429 --> 00:14:47,096
Oh, my God.

222
00:14:48,303 --> 00:14:50,130
I know!

223
00:14:51,124 --> 00:14:53,008
It's incredible!

224
00:14:53,128 --> 00:14:56,052
Oh, sorry. That was too hard.

225
00:14:56,172 --> 00:14:58,294
I'm just... I'm so excited.

226
00:14:59,162 --> 00:15:01,557
- I still can't believe I did it.
- Yeah.

227
00:15:01,557 --> 00:15:04,291
Neither can I. Are you okay?

228
00:15:04,316 --> 00:15:07,177
Me? Am I okay? Are you okay?

229
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:09,206
- Yes, thank you.
- Were you scared?

230
00:15:09,207 --> 00:15:11,808
I mean, I was scared too, but
you... You had to be terrified.

231
00:15:11,809 --> 00:15:13,764
Because you had no idea
I was coming to save you.

232
00:15:13,817 --> 00:15:16,913
- I need a drink.
- Right! Yeah, we need to celebrate.

233
00:15:17,732 --> 00:15:21,441
It has been so long... I
almost forgot how to fly.

234
00:15:21,696 --> 00:15:25,034
Well, not so much "how", but more...

235
00:15:25,036 --> 00:15:27,284
more how it feels, like...

236
00:15:28,698 --> 00:15:31,158
scared, but good scared.

237
00:15:31,158 --> 00:15:35,602
Like... like that moment right before
you kiss someone for the first time.

238
00:15:35,624 --> 00:15:38,065
And now... now it's like...

239
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:40,293
I'm not sure what comes next.

240
00:15:40,575 --> 00:15:43,687
Or maybe I am sure and I'm
just afraid of what it means...

241
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:47,172
- and if it means what I think it means.
- What were you thinking?

242
00:15:52,221 --> 00:15:54,537
You exposed yourself.

243
00:15:55,009 --> 00:15:56,133
To the world.

244
00:15:56,253 --> 00:15:58,158
You're out there now, Kara.

245
00:15:58,192 --> 00:16:01,831
Everyone will know about you
and you can't take that back.

246
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:04,496
I don't want to.

247
00:16:06,105 --> 00:16:08,626
This is what I was talking about, Alex.

248
00:16:09,374 --> 00:16:12,756
I've always felt the need to help people,

249
00:16:12,758 --> 00:16:15,910
and tonight I finally got that chance.

250
00:16:19,769 --> 00:16:23,418
I didn't travel 2.000 light
years just to be an assistant.

251
00:16:23,419 --> 00:16:26,777
What if people figure out who you are?

252
00:16:27,542 --> 00:16:29,318
What you are?

253
00:16:30,438 --> 00:16:31,851
It's just...

254
00:16:31,852 --> 00:16:33,332
_

255
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:35,549
It's not safe

256
00:16:35,789 --> 00:16:38,164
for you to do anything like that.

257
00:16:38,616 --> 00:16:40,192
Ever again.

258
00:16:47,937 --> 00:16:50,283
I'm kind of tired, I just...

259
00:16:50,499 --> 00:16:53,433
carried a plane on my
back. I'm gonna go to bed.

260
00:16:56,919 --> 00:16:58,423
You should go.

261
00:16:58,963 --> 00:17:00,764
Don't say I didn't warn you.

262
00:17:07,805 --> 00:17:10,405
Good morning, National City. Our top story,

263
00:17:10,413 --> 00:17:12,606
the only story anyone's talking about:

264
00:17:12,619 --> 00:17:16,221
who is the mystery flying
woman who saved the plane?

265
00:17:23,374 --> 00:17:24,988
Despite extensive efforts,

266
00:17:24,994 --> 00:17:29,171
no one has been able to identify
who or rather what she is.

267
00:17:29,973 --> 00:17:32,792
Oh, my God, Kara. You're a life saver.

268
00:17:35,132 --> 00:17:38,009
Thanks for doing those comps for
me. Cat said I did great work.

269
00:17:38,009 --> 00:17:41,031
Oh, sure, Hayashi. No big deal.

270
00:17:41,856 --> 00:17:44,542
Her timing, seriously, she is...

271
00:17:45,127 --> 00:17:48,265
- Pretty cool, huh?
- A plane-saving lady?

272
00:17:48,384 --> 00:17:51,785
How is the world supposed to take you
seriously if you can't even come up with a suit?

273
00:17:52,284 --> 00:17:55,134
Metropolis gets him and
what does National City get?

274
00:17:55,167 --> 00:17:56,779
Some rookie superhero?

275
00:17:59,738 --> 00:18:01,912
- _
- I know many of you...

276
00:18:01,939 --> 00:18:04,008
are used to being second best

277
00:18:04,048 --> 00:18:06,192
but it's new to me.

278
00:18:06,311 --> 00:18:09,505
The most incredible event in
the history of National City

279
00:18:09,531 --> 00:18:11,740
and yet we have no exclusive of any kind.

280
00:18:11,779 --> 00:18:12,795
We don't have much to go on.

281
00:18:12,796 --> 00:18:14,300
The image we're working off is low res.

282
00:18:14,327 --> 00:18:15,321
I guess she's around 5'9''.

283
00:18:15,368 --> 00:18:17,717
It's tough to gauge with her
height measured against an airplane.

284
00:18:17,756 --> 00:18:20,618
Hair color brown. Or... black.

285
00:18:21,167 --> 00:18:23,087
Or maybe her hair is just dirty.

286
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:26,076
You know, from soot.

287
00:18:26,455 --> 00:18:29,585
- The plane exhaust.
- James, you make an excellent point.

288
00:18:30,592 --> 00:18:33,345
Do you think there's any
connection between this hero

289
00:18:33,367 --> 00:18:34,974
- and...
- To my friend in blue?

290
00:18:35,843 --> 00:18:38,760
I don't know. I mean, not
that he mentioned, but...

291
00:18:38,761 --> 00:18:40,792
if she's anything like him,

292
00:18:40,913 --> 00:18:41,913
she's a hero.

293
00:18:43,188 --> 00:18:46,242
Saving people's what they're
born to do. She'll be back.

294
00:18:47,968 --> 00:18:49,592
She better be.

295
00:18:50,032 --> 00:18:52,778
This girl is the answer.

296
00:18:52,778 --> 00:18:55,835
She is exactly what I
need to save the Tribune.

297
00:18:55,836 --> 00:18:59,844
Besides fatty foods, there is
nothing people love more than a hero.

298
00:18:59,845 --> 00:19:02,118
We are going to blow her up.

299
00:19:02,119 --> 00:19:05,108
We will feature her
online and in the paper,

300
00:19:05,122 --> 00:19:06,509
but we need images,

301
00:19:06,542 --> 00:19:11,900
we need video, we need an interview,
an exclusive content. So go.

302
00:19:12,153 --> 00:19:13,727
Go get me that girl.

303
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:15,563
And Kara...

304
00:19:16,242 --> 00:19:18,204
Go get me a lettuce wrap.

305
00:19:19,861 --> 00:19:22,741
It's funny. That was
the first thing he did.

306
00:19:23,403 --> 00:19:25,067
Save a plane, I mean.

307
00:19:32,423 --> 00:19:35,276
Winn, I need to talk to you on the roof.

308
00:19:37,565 --> 00:19:39,286
The roof?

309
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:42,079
Kara?

310
00:19:42,724 --> 00:19:45,563
Hey, uh, just whatever you have
to say, can you make it quick?

311
00:19:45,576 --> 00:19:47,758
I'm not really into being this high up.

312
00:19:47,877 --> 00:19:50,372
Okay, uhm... Winn...

313
00:19:50,905 --> 00:19:53,218
I'm going to tell you something about me

314
00:19:53,219 --> 00:19:55,500
that only three people in my life know.

315
00:19:55,621 --> 00:19:57,269
Can I trust you?

316
00:19:58,232 --> 00:20:00,787
- Yeah, yeah, of course.
- Good.

317
00:20:00,906 --> 00:20:05,257
I just... really want
someone to be excited for me.

318
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:06,637
And I, uhm...

319
00:20:07,992 --> 00:20:09,779
Right, how do...

320
00:20:11,258 --> 00:20:13,528
There's something about me...

321
00:20:13,529 --> 00:20:16,813
that for most of my life, I've ran from it.

322
00:20:16,932 --> 00:20:21,423
But last night I embraced who
I am and I don't wanna stop.

323
00:20:21,424 --> 00:20:23,957
Oh, my God, you're a lesbian.

324
00:20:24,555 --> 00:20:26,636
Oh, Kara, that is why you're not into me.

325
00:20:26,637 --> 00:20:29,695
- This is... this is great news!
- No. I'm not gay!

326
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,738
I am...

327
00:20:33,008 --> 00:20:34,651
I'm her!

328
00:20:37,011 --> 00:20:39,430
The woman who saved the plane!

329
00:20:43,415 --> 00:20:44,836
Okay.

330
00:20:45,563 --> 00:20:47,499
Yeah, okay. Right.

331
00:20:50,714 --> 00:20:53,169
Kara, what are you doing? Hey, Kara!

332
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:55,951
Hey, get away from the
ledge, you're gonna get hurt.

333
00:20:58,269 --> 00:21:00,481
Kara! Hey!

334
00:21:07,265 --> 00:21:09,337
You're... you're her!

335
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:11,213
Yep.

336
00:21:15,263 --> 00:21:17,199
More reports coming in to
last night's plane rescue.

337
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,867
The big question: is there a connection
between this mysterious flying woman...

338
00:21:20,894 --> 00:21:23,556
- More coffee.
- ...and the Man of Steel?

339
00:21:25,237 --> 00:21:27,388
- Hey!
- Sorry about that, sir.

340
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:30,441
Can you believe it? A female hero.

341
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:33,447
Nice for my daughter to have
someone like that to look up to.

342
00:21:33,448 --> 00:21:35,584
Yeah, real nice.

343
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:54,809
What happened with the plane, Vartox?
You were ordered to bring it down.

344
00:21:54,858 --> 00:21:56,310
Our trap worked.

345
00:21:56,311 --> 00:21:58,942
The DEO agents were on
board and the bomb detonated.

346
00:21:58,942 --> 00:22:01,602
- Then why aren't they dead?
- The female...

347
00:22:01,603 --> 00:22:03,626
She flew into the sky and caught the plane.

348
00:22:03,627 --> 00:22:05,055
Who is she?

349
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:08,457
Jor-El saved his child
before Krypton's destruction.

350
00:22:08,999 --> 00:22:12,067
- Alura's daughter.
- She's working with the humans.

351
00:22:12,068 --> 00:22:13,516
12 years.

352
00:22:13,517 --> 00:22:15,941
We've been forced to hide in the shadows.

353
00:22:15,965 --> 00:22:19,766
But the General's arrival is
imminent. Nothing must interfere.

354
00:22:19,826 --> 00:22:23,660
You are instructed to continue your
orders to eliminate the human operatives.

355
00:22:23,661 --> 00:22:27,943
- You can add this girl to the list.
- Can't promise her death won't be public.

356
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:31,983
- And messy.
- Human casualties are irrelevant.

357
00:22:31,984 --> 00:22:33,434
Good.

358
00:22:36,189 --> 00:22:39,704
And if she is Alura's Zar-El's daughter...

359
00:22:39,991 --> 00:22:42,563
then she will pay for her mother's debts.

360
00:22:42,682 --> 00:22:44,188
And so will her city.

361
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:53,432
So, how is it? Huh? How does it fit?

362
00:22:54,616 --> 00:22:57,230
I'm not flying around
saving people in this thing.

363
00:22:57,231 --> 00:23:00,837
I... I wouldn't even wear it
to the beach. Where's my cape?

364
00:23:00,838 --> 00:23:04,933
Capes are lame. You can tell your cousin
I said so. Actually, never, never do that.

365
00:23:14,914 --> 00:23:17,529
You look really pretty
without your glasses.

366
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:18,808
- Winn...
- So...

367
00:23:19,596 --> 00:23:21,859
To be a superhero you need a crime.

368
00:23:21,861 --> 00:23:24,329
I hacked into the NCPD.

369
00:23:24,779 --> 00:23:27,164
There's a car chase on the 112 freeway.

370
00:23:27,165 --> 00:23:28,829
I can do a car chase!

371
00:23:37,653 --> 00:23:40,508
A cape aids with aerodynamics,
I should have thought of that.

372
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:43,772
West National City Bank
reporting a 432 at 6th and Spring.

373
00:23:43,773 --> 00:23:47,346
- Suspects are armed and dangerous.
- You, uh, you're sure you're bulletproof?

374
00:23:47,684 --> 00:23:49,130
Hope so.

375
00:24:01,673 --> 00:24:04,721
All right, the new cape is made
from a structured polymer composites,

376
00:24:04,722 --> 00:24:06,339
much sturdier than...

377
00:24:06,752 --> 00:24:08,217
And...

378
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,775
This one has the "S".

379
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:14,301
For "Super", just like your cousin.

380
00:24:15,144 --> 00:24:16,800
It's not an "S".

381
00:24:18,242 --> 00:24:20,494
It's my family's coat of arms.

382
00:24:21,395 --> 00:24:23,034
The House of El.

383
00:24:23,403 --> 00:24:25,133
***

384
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:26,911
I'm assuming you can't catch on fire.

385
00:25:01,661 --> 00:25:03,501
Made of low grade Kryptonite.

386
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:06,211
Radioactive mineral from your home planet.

387
00:25:06,332 --> 00:25:09,378
- It weakens you.
- Where... where am I?

388
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:12,480
- Who are you?
- My name is Hank Henshaw.

389
00:25:13,157 --> 00:25:15,125
And I believe you already know

390
00:25:15,151 --> 00:25:16,935
Agent Danvers.

391
00:25:19,161 --> 00:25:20,971
She doesn't need this.

392
00:25:25,597 --> 00:25:27,211
Welcome to the DEO,

393
00:25:27,332 --> 00:25:29,790
the Department of Extranormal Operations.

394
00:25:31,971 --> 00:25:36,676
The DEO monitors and protects Earth
from extraterrestrial presence and or...

395
00:25:36,677 --> 00:25:38,326
invasion.

396
00:25:39,372 --> 00:25:40,923
That means you.

397
00:25:43,654 --> 00:25:44,885
Your ship.

398
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:48,730
We keep it here as a reminder
of the day you crashed on Earth.

399
00:25:49,067 --> 00:25:51,369
You are the reason for all of this.

400
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:53,198
Me? But...

401
00:25:53,199 --> 00:25:56,218
My... But my cousin was here
two dozen years before me.

402
00:25:56,251 --> 00:25:59,180
And it was his arrival that triggered
the need for this organization.

403
00:25:59,299 --> 00:26:01,119
We realised we weren't
alone in the universe

404
00:26:01,152 --> 00:26:03,253
and we might soon be getting more...

405
00:26:03,968 --> 00:26:04,968
immigrants.

406
00:26:05,015 --> 00:26:06,796
Sure enough, you came along.

407
00:26:06,797 --> 00:26:08,463
And with you...

408
00:26:09,154 --> 00:26:10,553
Fort Rozz.

409
00:26:11,172 --> 00:26:13,059
Fort Rozz?

410
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:15,656
Krypton's Maximum Security prison.

411
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:18,272
Banished at the Phantom Zone,
same place your ship got stuck,

412
00:26:18,273 --> 00:26:20,596
but just like yours it didn't stay there.

413
00:26:25,731 --> 00:26:28,191
We're not sure how your pod got loose.

414
00:26:31,066 --> 00:26:32,523
What we do know is this:

415
00:26:32,644 --> 00:26:34,817
you pulled Fort Rozz with you.

416
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:38,454
When it crashed,

417
00:26:38,575 --> 00:26:39,981
the alien convicts...

418
00:26:40,165 --> 00:26:43,221
the worst criminals in the
galaxy, they all escaped.

419
00:26:43,704 --> 00:26:45,480
And you brought them here.

420
00:26:47,134 --> 00:26:48,302
This beings...

421
00:26:48,377 --> 00:26:51,077
Some of them have powers
from your darkest nightmares.

422
00:26:51,525 --> 00:26:53,465
For over a decade they've stayed hidden.

423
00:26:53,467 --> 00:26:56,131
But in the last year
many have been emerging...

424
00:26:56,132 --> 00:26:57,748
making themselves known.

425
00:26:57,867 --> 00:26:59,381
They're planning something.

426
00:26:59,605 --> 00:27:01,428
We're just not sure what it is yet.

427
00:27:01,429 --> 00:27:02,865
Your plane.

428
00:27:02,866 --> 00:27:05,715
That wasn't an accident.
They were trying to kill you.

429
00:27:06,135 --> 00:27:07,579
I can help you stop them.

430
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:10,025
How? You couldn't even
stop us from capturing you.

431
00:27:10,026 --> 00:27:12,078
I... I'm still learning.

432
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:14,851
Our job is keeping people in the
dark about alien life on Earth,

433
00:27:14,873 --> 00:27:18,006
and nothing says "covert operation"
like a flying woman in a red skirt.

434
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:20,353
They know about my cousin,
they don't fear him.

435
00:27:20,375 --> 00:27:23,480
Plenty of people do, just
not popular to admit it.

436
00:27:24,205 --> 00:27:25,396
You wanna help?

437
00:27:25,659 --> 00:27:27,457
Go back to getting someone's coffee.

438
00:27:30,538 --> 00:27:32,756
I know you're mad and you're hurt.

439
00:27:32,758 --> 00:27:34,671
I wanted to tell you every single day...

440
00:27:34,709 --> 00:27:38,300
Instead, you told me every single
day not to be who I really am.

441
00:27:38,301 --> 00:27:40,582
- You have to listen to me.
- I can't!

442
00:27:40,583 --> 00:27:44,036
This just kind of feels like
one big coincidence, doesn't it?

443
00:27:44,427 --> 00:27:47,729
You working here, hunting
down aliens, me being one?

444
00:27:48,371 --> 00:27:49,875
I can't help but think

445
00:27:49,886 --> 00:27:52,867
the real reason that you were
recruited was because of me.

446
00:27:52,988 --> 00:27:56,409
They recruited me because my
background in bioengineering

447
00:27:56,414 --> 00:27:58,968
makes me an expert in alien physiology.

448
00:27:59,887 --> 00:28:00,887
And, yeah,

449
00:28:01,315 --> 00:28:03,394
it helps that I shared a bathroom with one.

450
00:28:03,513 --> 00:28:04,864
I'm leaving now.

451
00:28:05,151 --> 00:28:06,834
Unless you wanna try and stop me.

452
00:28:07,325 --> 00:28:08,770
Which I wouldn't.

453
00:28:12,387 --> 00:28:15,606
I know you don't wanna hear this,
Agent Danvers, but she's dangerous.

454
00:28:16,028 --> 00:28:18,008
You above all people should know that.

455
00:28:28,174 --> 00:28:32,055
Of course leave it to media magnate
Cat Grant to put a name to her face.

456
00:28:32,092 --> 00:28:35,810
Ms. Grant dubbed National City's
new female here "Supergirl".

457
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:39,557
And if Twitter is any indicator,
the name appears to be catching...

458
00:28:39,973 --> 00:28:41,574
"Supergirl"?

459
00:28:43,094 --> 00:28:45,020
We can't name her that!

460
00:28:47,697 --> 00:28:49,888
"We" didn't.

461
00:28:50,009 --> 00:28:51,900
Right, I'm...

462
00:28:52,732 --> 00:28:55,763
sorry. It's just...

463
00:28:56,801 --> 00:29:00,411
I don't want to minimize
the importance of this.

464
00:29:00,412 --> 00:29:03,260
A female superhero,

465
00:29:03,261 --> 00:29:06,308
shouldn't she be called Superwoman?

466
00:29:06,352 --> 00:29:10,492
I'm sorry, darling, I just can't hear you
over the loud color of your cheap pants.

467
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:14,929
If we call her "Supergirl",
something less than what she is,

468
00:29:14,930 --> 00:29:16,538
doesn't that make us

469
00:29:16,659 --> 00:29:19,528
guilty of being anti-feminist?

470
00:29:20,979 --> 00:29:22,397
Didn't you say she was a hero?

471
00:29:22,398 --> 00:29:23,872
I'm the hero.

472
00:29:24,405 --> 00:29:27,159
I stuck a label on the side
of this girl, I branded her.

473
00:29:27,201 --> 00:29:30,548
She will forever be linked
to CatCo, to the Tribune...

474
00:29:30,782 --> 00:29:31,782
to me.

475
00:29:32,557 --> 00:29:33,557
And...

476
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:37,075
what do you this is so bad about "girl"?

477
00:29:40,758 --> 00:29:42,117
I'm a girl.

478
00:29:42,955 --> 00:29:44,643
And your boss,

479
00:29:44,818 --> 00:29:50,563
and powerful, and rich and hot and smart.

480
00:29:50,962 --> 00:29:54,092
So if you perceive "Supergirl"
as anything less than excellent,

481
00:29:54,093 --> 00:29:57,040
isn't the real problem you?

482
00:29:58,375 --> 00:30:00,114
And if you're so smart, Kara,

483
00:30:00,115 --> 00:30:04,526
could you please give me one
reason why I shouldn't fire you?

484
00:30:05,195 --> 00:30:06,511
I printed it.

485
00:30:06,684 --> 00:30:09,096
And it's an even higher
resolution than you hoped for.

486
00:30:09,098 --> 00:30:10,622
James...

487
00:30:10,623 --> 00:30:12,259
You are interrupting

488
00:30:12,281 --> 00:30:16,497
a very craftily worded termination.

489
00:30:18,141 --> 00:30:21,001
Kara wanted to surprise you,
but she had to tell her friend

490
00:30:21,011 --> 00:30:23,243
that works at West National City Bank.

491
00:30:24,594 --> 00:30:27,474
- The branch that got robbed.
- Right!

492
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:30,154
Right, yes, I went there.

493
00:30:30,791 --> 00:30:34,540
You know, it took me a while
to park my car in the...

494
00:30:34,951 --> 00:30:37,711
streets. The one-way
streets are so confusing.

495
00:30:38,871 --> 00:30:40,790
You tell it so much better...

496
00:30:42,434 --> 00:30:46,778
Kara convinced her source to allow us
to use a photograph that she captured.

497
00:30:55,748 --> 00:30:58,795
You got a clean image of Supergirl?

498
00:31:01,926 --> 00:31:02,926
Kara,

499
00:31:02,968 --> 00:31:04,846
if you can't take credit
when you do something well,

500
00:31:04,852 --> 00:31:07,194
you are gonna be at the
bottom of the pile forever.

501
00:31:08,467 --> 00:31:10,035
But mazel tov.

502
00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:13,289
You bought yourself another day.

503
00:31:15,183 --> 00:31:18,300
- I was handling the situation.
- Oh, yeah? What was your plan?

504
00:31:18,321 --> 00:31:20,169
To get yelled at and fired?
'Cause that was working.

505
00:31:20,184 --> 00:31:23,622
I don't need you or anyone
else fighting my battles for me.

506
00:31:24,065 --> 00:31:26,502
I'm communicating at 50,000 Hz.

507
00:31:26,557 --> 00:31:28,275
- If you can hear this,
- You okay?

508
00:31:28,307 --> 00:31:29,961
you were not born on this Earth.

509
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:33,240
Yeah, I... I have a
headache. I need some water.

510
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,132
Painful, isn't it?

511
00:31:35,251 --> 00:31:39,439
The humans of National City will suffer
ten times this pain if you don't face me.

512
00:31:39,471 --> 00:31:42,267
Meet me at the National City power plant.

513
00:31:42,288 --> 00:31:44,791
How many innocent people are going to die

514
00:31:44,824 --> 00:31:47,182
until you prove that you are not a coward?

515
00:31:47,301 --> 00:31:49,369
Daughter of Alura.

516
00:32:11,173 --> 00:32:14,045
Clever. Picking a spot lined with led.

517
00:32:15,416 --> 00:32:17,594
But I can still hear your heart beat.

518
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:30,182
On my planet, females bow before males.

519
00:32:30,588 --> 00:32:33,486
- This is not your planet.
- You look like Alura.

520
00:32:33,528 --> 00:32:34,926
How do you know my mother's name?

521
00:32:34,952 --> 00:32:37,710
You don't easily forget the name of
the woman who condemned you to prison.

522
00:32:37,711 --> 00:32:39,040
Fort Rozz?

523
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:42,877
- What does that have to do with her?
- She was our judge.

524
00:32:43,042 --> 00:32:44,095
And jailer.

525
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,089
Can't kill her...

526
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,176
so killing you will have to do.

527
00:33:10,825 --> 00:33:14,327
Just because you wear that symbol in
your chest doesn't mean you're him.

528
00:33:14,328 --> 00:33:16,277
Fighting him would be an honor.

529
00:33:16,396 --> 00:33:18,845
Fighting you is just exercise.

530
00:33:26,009 --> 00:33:28,470
You actually think that you could stop me?

531
00:33:28,471 --> 00:33:30,722
That you'd be able to stop any of us?

532
00:33:48,211 --> 00:33:49,894
Now you know what is like to bleed.

533
00:33:49,894 --> 00:33:52,845
Soon, your whole city will bleed.

534
00:34:07,048 --> 00:34:10,255
- ***-1, pursue the hostile.
- Copy that.

535
00:34:17,717 --> 00:34:22,081
Hey, hey, I'm here. I got you, I got you.

536
00:34:28,429 --> 00:34:32,673
- You're gonna be okay.
- I never felt pain like that before.

537
00:34:33,425 --> 00:34:36,201
I never felt pain.

538
00:34:36,728 --> 00:34:38,802
You're not indestructible, Kara.

539
00:34:38,804 --> 00:34:41,623
Nice move nearly letting
that alien cut you in half.

540
00:34:41,826 --> 00:34:44,465
If we can ID his weapon, it
might give us a way to defeat him.

541
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:46,286
Look at that...

542
00:34:48,335 --> 00:34:49,784
You did help.

543
00:34:53,751 --> 00:34:55,525
Did you know about my mom?

544
00:34:56,224 --> 00:34:59,047
That she was the one who
locked up all those aliens?

545
00:35:00,485 --> 00:35:02,775
It's why I didn't want you going out there.

546
00:35:03,143 --> 00:35:04,291
Showing yourself,

547
00:35:04,525 --> 00:35:05,748
showing this.

548
00:35:06,735 --> 00:35:09,557
The Fort Rozz escapees would give anything

549
00:35:09,559 --> 00:35:13,384
to get revenge on your mother and the
only way that they can do that now...

550
00:35:13,385 --> 00:35:15,193
is to hurt you.

551
00:35:16,057 --> 00:35:17,931
I'm trying to protect you.

552
00:35:18,166 --> 00:35:19,356
You were right.

553
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:23,016
The world doesn't need me.

554
00:35:46,309 --> 00:35:48,184
Kara, it's me.

555
00:35:49,047 --> 00:35:50,458
Can we talk?

556
00:35:53,362 --> 00:35:55,581
I know you can see me.

557
00:35:58,152 --> 00:36:00,063
I know what you're thinking.

558
00:36:01,215 --> 00:36:03,128
That this is all your fault.

559
00:36:03,778 --> 00:36:04,846
But it's not.

560
00:36:06,411 --> 00:36:08,811
Before you came to live with us...

561
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:11,490
I was the star.

562
00:36:12,605 --> 00:36:14,896
And then, I mean...

563
00:36:15,016 --> 00:36:17,748
How could I compete with you?

564
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:19,306
With someone

565
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:22,135
who could touch the stars?

566
00:36:24,248 --> 00:36:26,648
And I was happy when you decided not to use

567
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:28,543
your powers. You know, you...

568
00:36:29,199 --> 00:36:32,027
feeling like less somehow...

569
00:36:34,735 --> 00:36:36,677
made me feel like more.

570
00:36:39,762 --> 00:36:41,088
Now...

571
00:36:42,798 --> 00:36:45,824
The world needs you to fly, Kara.

572
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:51,708
I can't, Alex.

573
00:36:52,146 --> 00:36:55,264
- I can't do it.
- Yeah, you can.

574
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,768
- Your family believes in you.
- I know you do.

575
00:36:58,768 --> 00:37:01,134
Oh, I don't mean me.

576
00:37:04,164 --> 00:37:06,947
- That's Kryptonese writing.
- Yeah.

577
00:37:07,067 --> 00:37:10,771
Hank and his old team recovered it
from the pod that brought you to Earth.

578
00:37:18,248 --> 00:37:22,304
- Mom.
- Kara, my brave daughter.

579
00:37:23,115 --> 00:37:26,782
By now you have become the woman
I knew you would grow up to be.

580
00:37:28,014 --> 00:37:31,168
And though you were sent to
Earth to protect young Kal-El,

581
00:37:31,289 --> 00:37:34,039
your destiny is not tied to his.

582
00:37:34,338 --> 00:37:37,204
There is no correct path in life.

583
00:37:37,744 --> 00:37:40,117
You will lose your way many times.

584
00:37:40,295 --> 00:37:41,356
What's important

585
00:37:41,431 --> 00:37:45,016
is that you find your way back
to the brave girl you always were.

586
00:37:45,405 --> 00:37:46,501
Be wise,

587
00:37:47,726 --> 00:37:48,726
be strong...

588
00:37:49,543 --> 00:37:51,769
and always be true to yourself.

589
00:38:09,092 --> 00:38:11,018
So, what do we do now?

590
00:38:11,019 --> 00:38:12,860
First thing first.

591
00:38:13,344 --> 00:38:15,114
You need to change.

592
00:38:27,181 --> 00:38:30,215
It's Agent Danvers and her
sister from another planet.

593
00:38:30,434 --> 00:38:34,088
- She's here to help us fight Vartox.
- I told you I don't trust aliens.

594
00:38:34,721 --> 00:38:36,501
There's no one I trust more.

595
00:38:37,077 --> 00:38:40,427
Like her cousin, she was
sent here too, to help us.

596
00:38:40,547 --> 00:38:42,887
And if you want anymore of my help,

597
00:38:43,202 --> 00:38:45,659
- we're gonna let her.
- I found Vartox.

598
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:48,505
Sir, ma'ams...

599
00:38:49,014 --> 00:38:50,239
Where?

600
00:38:50,304 --> 00:38:52,960
The sliver of metal you
extracted from Supergirl's arm.

601
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:55,608
Vartox's axe has a unique nuclear thumbprint.

602
00:38:56,123 --> 00:38:58,083
Satellites picked him up
heading towards the city.

603
00:38:58,190 --> 00:39:00,869
Vartox said he was ready
to start killing humans.

604
00:39:00,989 --> 00:39:03,630
- Looks like tonight's the night.
- Order strike team to intercept.

605
00:39:03,632 --> 00:39:06,764
- Your men will not be able to stop him.
- Thank you for your opinion, Ms. Danvers.

606
00:39:06,775 --> 00:39:08,423
Director Henshaw...

607
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:13,525
People of this city will die
because of something I did.

608
00:39:14,215 --> 00:39:15,688
I started this.

609
00:39:15,943 --> 00:39:17,755
You have to let me stop it.

610
00:39:19,514 --> 00:39:21,347
Make sure you win.

611
00:39:28,817 --> 00:39:30,592
Do you have eyes on the target?

612
00:39:31,838 --> 00:39:33,259
I got him.

613
00:39:52,012 --> 00:39:54,076
You never should have come back for war.

614
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,880
She's not strong enough.

615
00:40:08,882 --> 00:40:11,746
Why? Because she's just a girl?

616
00:40:12,117 --> 00:40:14,306
It's exactly what we were counting on.

617
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:23,922
I analyzed the metal on the axe.

618
00:40:23,972 --> 00:40:26,257
It's powered by a
self-generating atomic charge

619
00:40:26,282 --> 00:40:28,840
reaching temperatures up to 2500 degrees.

620
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,510
- How does that help?
- If it gets any hotter than that...

621
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:32,849
it's gonna explode.

622
00:40:33,038 --> 00:40:35,693
She just has to get close
enough to do her thing.

623
00:40:57,594 --> 00:40:59,628
Stop... I give up.

624
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:03,197
- I don't wanna die.
- Give your mother my regards.

625
00:41:04,730 --> 00:41:06,474
Kara, do it now.

626
00:41:16,565 --> 00:41:19,938
It's not working. I can't do it!

627
00:41:20,057 --> 00:41:21,858
It's why you were sent here.

628
00:41:21,978 --> 00:41:25,112
I believe that now, you
have to believe it too.

629
00:41:49,083 --> 00:41:50,554
It's over.

630
00:41:50,556 --> 00:41:52,579
You think I'm the threat?

631
00:41:53,733 --> 00:41:56,079
You have no idea what's coming.

632
00:42:14,391 --> 00:42:17,246
She followed your orders. She won.

633
00:42:17,246 --> 00:42:19,322
Yeah. The first time.

634
00:42:19,909 --> 00:42:21,539
Director Henshaw...

635
00:42:22,599 --> 00:42:26,603
I wasn't only recruited
because of my sister, was I?

636
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:29,413
Yeah, she's why you got in.

637
00:42:29,851 --> 00:42:33,123
You are why you get to stay.

638
00:42:42,177 --> 00:42:45,079
If... If I believe that
comments on the website,

639
00:42:45,110 --> 00:42:49,597
they mentioned a "female/reptilian
boxing match in the desert".

640
00:42:49,623 --> 00:42:52,047
I'll tell you all about it
at our next crime-fighting lunch hour.

641
00:42:52,048 --> 00:42:55,054
- Wait, so the super friends are back?
- We're not calling ourselves that.

642
00:42:56,153 --> 00:42:57,572
James.

643
00:42:59,369 --> 00:43:02,541
- Do you have time to grab lunch?
- You must be hungry.

644
00:43:03,612 --> 00:43:06,903
Probably burned a lot of calories
fighting an axe-wielding alien.

645
00:43:06,945 --> 00:43:08,815
Meet me on the roof.

646
00:43:19,137 --> 00:43:20,804
You knew?

647
00:43:21,210 --> 00:43:23,038
This whole time?

648
00:43:23,907 --> 00:43:25,317
He told you?

649
00:43:25,318 --> 00:43:28,753
Well, he knew that I was trying
to expand my own horizons,

650
00:43:28,773 --> 00:43:32,554
so, as a favor, he asked me to
expand them here, National City.

651
00:43:33,887 --> 00:43:35,179
Hang out.

652
00:43:35,742 --> 00:43:36,768
Be near you.

653
00:43:37,099 --> 00:43:38,927
So, wait a minute. He...

654
00:43:38,929 --> 00:43:41,260
He wanted me to do this?

655
00:43:43,099 --> 00:43:45,077
Why didn't he just tell me?

656
00:43:45,079 --> 00:43:48,010
Because he wanted you to
choose it for yourself.

657
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:50,451
The same way he did.

658
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:53,126
That's what makes a hero, Kara.

659
00:43:53,929 --> 00:43:55,043
Here.

660
00:43:55,525 --> 00:43:57,186
From him.

661
00:44:11,311 --> 00:44:14,110
It's the blanket he was
wrapped in when he was a baby.

662
00:44:14,112 --> 00:44:16,784
Apparently this cape won't shred.

663
00:44:20,476 --> 00:44:21,949
Thank you.

664
00:44:24,436 --> 00:44:26,494
He's really proud of you.

665
00:44:27,418 --> 00:44:28,885
Me too.

666
00:44:29,643 --> 00:44:32,483
Now, don't you have a city to protect?

667
00:44:32,771 --> 00:44:35,788
You know... up, up and away?

668
00:44:42,876 --> 00:44:45,577
I was sent here to protect my cousin.

669
00:44:45,579 --> 00:44:48,666
Turns out he didn't need my protection.

670
00:44:48,786 --> 00:44:52,355
But there's a whole planet
full of people who do.

671
00:44:59,878 --> 00:45:02,534
Earth doesn't have just one hero anymore.

672
00:45:02,536 --> 00:45:04,480
Now it has me.

673
00:45:04,599 --> 00:45:07,420
Now it has Supergirl.

674
00:45:10,039 --> 00:45:12,242
General, Vartox is dead.

675
00:45:12,242 --> 00:45:14,090
He chose death over capture.

676
00:45:14,092 --> 00:45:16,952
- Typical of his race.
- He did accomplish one thing.

677
00:45:16,952 --> 00:45:18,826
The identity of the girl.

678
00:45:18,827 --> 00:45:22,818
It seems... she is Alura's daughter.

679
00:45:23,688 --> 00:45:25,748
My dear little niece.

680
00:45:26,416 --> 00:45:27,893
Of course.

681
00:45:29,557 --> 00:45:31,436
She escaped with her cousin.

682
00:45:31,438 --> 00:45:34,175
A much less of a threat
than he is to our endeavors.

683
00:45:34,193 --> 00:45:35,494
You're wrong.

684
00:45:35,697 --> 00:45:39,574
If she's anything like her mother,
she will just as formidable.

685
00:45:39,764 --> 00:45:41,375
It was my right

686
00:45:41,494 --> 00:45:43,739
to lead Krypton, I will lead Earth.

687
00:45:44,882 --> 00:45:46,559
We all will.

688
00:45:47,177 --> 00:45:48,983
Find her and kill her.

689
00:45:48,983 --> 00:45:50,922
Are you certain, General?

690
00:45:51,041 --> 00:45:52,510
After all...

691
00:45:52,512 --> 00:45:55,317
Kara Zor-El is your blood.

692
00:45:55,318 --> 00:45:58,356
No one can be allowed to stand against us.

693
00:45:59,365 --> 00:46:01,588
Not even my niece.

694
00:46:04,472 --> 00:46:08,605
