Notes for Once

On Monday, you’ll watch the pilot from Once and collect data about
1.	who talks to whom
2.	who appears in scenes with whom
For Monday, you’ll need some way to take notes whether on your computer, on a mobile device, or on paper. You will need to upload your notes to GitHub, even if what you upload is a picture of the data you collected on paper.
Monday
•	network - set of relations between objects; in this class, we’re interested in social networks that are between people or other social actors (e.g., groups)
•	node - objects in a network; in today’s case, an individual (the character, not the actor)
•	edge/tie - connections between objects in a network; in today’s case, we have two different kids of ties - association and dialogue.
o	association - a tie exists between two people when they appear in the same scene; is not directed
o	dialogue - a tie exists between two people when one talks to the other; is directed
