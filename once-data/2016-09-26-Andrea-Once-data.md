Analyzing Video:

Egocentric networks

Key concepts for social networks:

Node: anything that you as a researcher defines
	Object in the network
	Also called an actor 
	Actor could be people/organizations
		Depends on the analysis you are doing as a researcher defines it

Edge/tie- connections between the objects in the network
	Ex: Carlos and Robert (each is a node)
	The edge/tie- is called undirected relation/directed relationship
	Ex: Carlos indicates a directional tie to Robert (i.e the friendship)
	Bidirectional relationship- both sides confirm that there is a relationship
	
	Interaction patterns- who's talking to who?
	
Networks- you can look at it from a matrix standpoint 
You can individually look at the ties 

Who speaks to who?- directional
Speaking / who is talking to whom?

Affiliation/ nearest neighbor/ who is next to who?

<x, y> directional

(x,y) undirectional

How do we define speaking? What our unit of analysis 

	Words
	Common topic
	Important characters 
	How do you define the scene? 
	



Possible things to analyze: 

	• Who dominates the conversation?
	• Who speaks first?
	• How does the back and forth look like?
	• What is the strength of tie?
	• What is the relation?
	• Who might be doing it more talking?
	• Emotional?
	• Understanding the context will help us understand the relationship 
	• Length of conversation
	• Eye gaze
	• Body orientation
	• Breaking it down by scene 
	• Attribute- something outside the analysis that we use to
